The Self-Propelled Advancing Skimmers (SPAS) represents a vital part of CCG\u0092s new Environmental Response capability. Presently, CCG is completely reliant on small portable skimmers for on-water oil skimming, which require external pumps and storage tanks as well as a vessel to transport the complete system. A SPAS is an autonomous piece of equipment, operated by only a few personnel, which can rapidly advance and recover spilled oil from the water using a built-in oil recovery and storage capability without relying on the use of any additional equipment. This system will greatly increase the response time for spills, stemming the dispersal of the slick and resulting in greater amounts of oil recovered.   This procurement is part of the Environmental Response Equipment (ERE) Program for the CCG, and forms part of the Oceans Protection Plan announced in November 2016. Under the ERE Program, CCG is renewing its suite of environmental response (ER) equipment, ensuring a robust and strategic national response capability. The ERE Program will replace aging ER equipment and introduce some new technologies to over 80 locations across the country through approximately 50-100 unique procurements for different types of equipment.  The requirement is subject to the provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).  This procurement is subject to the Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement and may be Huron-Wendat Nation, Mohawks of Quebec, Regroupement Petapan Land Claim Agreements.  The Federal Contractors Program (FCP) for employment equity applies to this procurement; refer to Part 5 - Certifications and Additional Information, Part 7 - Resulting Contract Clauses and the annex titled Federal Contractors Program for Employment Equity - Certification.  Due to the nature of the bid solicitation, bids transmitted by facsimile, e-mail, or the epost Connect service to PWGSC will not be accepted. Bidders must refer to Part 2 of the bid solicitation entitled Instructions to bidders for further information.  Bidders intending to submit bids should obtain solicitation documents from the Government Electronic Tendering System (GETS) at http:\/\/BuyAndSell.gc.ca. Solicitation amendments, if and when issued, will be available on GETS. It is the responsibility of the Bidder to ensure that all amendments issued during the solicitation period have been obtained and addressed in the submitted bid. Bidders basing their submissions on solicitation documents obtained from other sources do so at their own risk.

The SLSA remains a procurement vehicle managed by PWGSC; however, certain software categories within the SLSA are restricted for the exclusive use of SSC.   Please see the Amendment Summary section below for a description of the Amendments issued against the RFSA to date.   ================================================================   Summary of the Request for Supply Arrangement (RFSA):  Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), on behalf of Canada, issued this Request for Supply Arrangement (RFSA) to implement the Software Licensing Supply Arrangement (SLSA). The SLSA is used to acquire off-the-shelf software licenses and related software maintenance and\/or support, as required by Canada, in support of its various programs, operational needs and projects. No professional service, \"as a service\" (e.g. software as a service, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service etc.), hardware or appliance solutions may be sold under this vehicle. It should be noted that this procurement vehicle is one of a number of vehicles that may be used to acquire such goods.   A Notice and the RFSA will be posted continuously on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) to allow suppliers to become qualified for a Supply Arrangements at any given time.  Description of the Software Licensing Supply Arrangement (SLSA):  The SLSA is a two-phased procurement vehicle. The first phase requires that suppliers qualify for a Supply Arrangement through the SLSA Request for Supply Arrangement (RFSA) that will be posted continuously on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS). Once qualified (i.e. awarded a Supply Arrangement), Suppliers are required to list their products and ceiling prices, in the appropriate category, in the SLSA Catalogue. The second phase of the procurement process consists of the SLSA authorized users issuing directed sole source contracts, competing requirements via Requests for Quotations (RFQs) for no substitute requirements when more than one source of supply exists or issuing bid solicitations when generic requirements exist. All second phase procurements will be processed in accordance with Canada's Government Contracting Regulations (GCR) and the applicable trade agreements.   Scope:  The RFSA will establish Supply Arrangements, including a Catalogue (hereinafter referred to as the Software Licensing Supply Arrangement (SLSA) Catalogue) for off-the-shelf software licenses and related software maintenance and\/or support. No professional service, \"as a service\" (e.g. software as a service, infrastructure as a service, platform as a service etc.), hardware or appliance solutions may be sold under this vehicle.  Any resulting Supply Arrangements may be used to acquire Goods for any Government Department, Departmental Corporation or Agency, or other Crown entity described in the Financial Administration Act (as amended from time to time), and any other party for which the Department of Public Works and Government Services may be authorized to act from time to time under section 16 of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act (each a \"Client\").  Delivery:  Any requirement for delivery to a destination in a land claims area will be actioned as a separate requisition outside of the SAs.  Evaluation: A Notice and the RFSA will be posted continuously on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) to allow suppliers to become qualified for a SA(s) at any given time.  All firms, including Aboriginal firms, are invited to submit Arrangement sunder this RFSA.  Those fully compliant Arrangements will be recommended for issuance of a Supply Arrangement.

Aboriginal SAs may be used by Approved PWGSC and Client Authorities, at their discretion, for both set-aside requirements and non-PSAB contracts.   Once a Supplier qualifies for an SA they will not be required to qualify again for additional categories. Canada will amend the existing SA for these Suppliers, at its sole discretion, to include one or more additional software categories at the Supplier's request, provided the required certifications are met.  Award:  The order of evaluation of arrangements will be at Canadas sole discretion. The intent is to evaluate arrangements on a first come, first served basis however this may change, as required, to meet Canadas operational requirements.   Canada will not award a Supplier a SA or delay award of Contract(s) to other Suppliers if a Supplier has not submitted complete documentation in its response or has submitted documentation that deviates from the terms of the RFSA.    All SAs will be effective from the date of issuance up to and including September 30, 2023, or until such time as Canada no longer considers it to be advantageous to have the SAs in place.  Security:  There is no security requirement associated with the issuance of a Supply Arrangement. The Contracts issued against this SA may, however, be subject to security requirements.    Trade Agreements:  The requirement is subject to the provisions of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).

In accordance with the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA), which includes principles supporting CSC\u2019s mandate, CSC must ensure that programs, plans, and supervision are in place to assist in an offender\u2019s reintegration.  A component of an offender\u2019s gradual, supervised release is the Community Residential Facility (CRF), which provides a bridge between the institution and the community, ensuring that suitable accommodation, support systems and monitoring are in place to assist conditionally released offenders to become law-abiding citizens.  CSC has approximately 200 contractual agreements with Community-Based Residential Facilities (CBRFs) across Canada, which provide specialized housing, counseling and supervision, at various levels of control and assistance.   CSC is encouraging interested suppliers to review the Letter of Interest (LOI) and the associated documentation and submit an expression of interest, in writing, in accordance with the instructions provided below.  Respondents will not be reimbursed for any costs incurred by participating in this LOI.  Respondents to this LOI should clearly identify any information submitted in writing that is to be considered as either in confidence or proprietary.  BACKGROUND   CSC, as part of the criminal justice system and respecting the rule of law, contributes to public safety by actively encouraging and assisting offenders to become law-abiding citizens, while exercising reasonable, safe, secure and humane control.   Offenders may be eligible for release before the end of their sentences, either through temporary absences, conditional release (full and day parole), or statutory release.  Decisions on the conditional release of offenders fall under the responsibility of the Parole Board of Canada. CSC is responsible for supervising federal offenders on conditional release in the community until the end of their sentences. This includes:  \u2022\tmanagement of offenders during their transition from the institution to the community, and while on supervision; and, \u2022\tensuring the safety and security of members of the public, victims, staff and offenders in the community.  CBRFs serve to enhance CSC\u2019s capacity to meet offenders\u2019 housing needs and increase their likelihood of safe and successful reintegration. \u2003 REQUIREMENTS  1. Tasks and accommodation requirements:  CSC's accommodation and supervision requirements in the community are described in Annex A, Statement of Work, attached to this notice. The details of the tasks are provided as a general description of the work and are subject to change.  In summary, CSC requires twenty-four (24) hour residential services for offenders for the provision of meals, monitoring, general support, and assistance, and may include enhanced program services for offenders experiencing community reintegration difficulties, and to address offenders\u2019 day-to-day reintegration concerns (e.g., life skills teaching, referrals to other community groups, employment support, support related to health issues, crisis intervention, etc.).  Work is required on an \"as and when requested\" basis and subject to CSC's fluctuating accommodation needs.  Suppliers are to note that CSC only requires the services described in the Statement of Work. CSC is neither seeking nor funding construction of new facilities, and the supplier will retain ownership of the CRF.   The period for delivery of services is normally for one year with additional option years. All options are exercised at CSC's sole discretion.  2. Security Requirements:  CRF suppliers are required to meet applicable security requirements before working with CSC Protected and Classified information and assets. Security screenings for suppliers are completed through the Canadian Industrial Security Directorate (CISD).  Additional clearances are required where a supplier must store Protected and\/or Classified information at their own work sites, or process and\/or transmit sensitive electronic data on their information technology systems.  For information related to CISD or Government Security for Contracts, please see the following link: http:\/\/ssi-iss.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca\/index-eng.html.   3. Insurance requirements  CRF suppliers must comply with standard insurance requirements, which at a minimum include Commercial General Liability Insurance for not less than $2,000,000 per accident or occurrence. Canada must be included as an additional insured with respect to liability arising out of the supplier's performance.   The supplier will be responsible for deciding if additional insurance coverage is necessary to fulfill its obligations and to ensure compliance with applicable law. Any additional insurance coverage will be at the supplier's expense, and for its own benefit and protection.   \u2003 LEGISLATION, TRADE AGREEMENTS, GOVERNMENT POLICIES, PERMITS AND LICENSES  CRF suppliers must comply with all applicable legislation, CSC's Commissioner's Directives (CDs), Standard Operating Practices and other standards applicable to the work. Information on the Acts and Regulations can be found on the CSC website at: http:\/\/www.csc-scc.gc.ca\/acts-and-regulations\/index-eng.shtml.  CRF suppliers must comply with all applicable territorial, provincial, municipal and local legislation and regulations, and are also responsible for all permits and licenses required to perform the work. The CRF premises and equipment must conform to applicable zoning, health, safety, building and fire codes and regulations.   ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS  Any supplier interested in providing CRF services to CSC will be assessed in relation to the following requirements.   A. two (2) years experience within the last five (5) years in working with adult offenders on conditional release.  B. two (2) years experience within the last five (5) years in providing accommodation to offenders in a residential setting.  CSC reserves the right to modify these requirements at any time in accordance with its needs  SCHEDULE  This LOI will remain posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) until such time that CSC determines, at its sole discretion, that it is no longer required.   SUBMISSION OF EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST  At any time, interested suppliers may submit their expression of interest in response to this LOI, in writing, to the Contracting Authority. The expression of interest may be in English or French, and describe the ability of a supplier to meet the requirements of the Statement of Work, and\/or provide comments and pose questions.  Submit By E-mail: Danielle.cameron@csc-scc.gc.ca  Please indicate file number: 21120-16-2222662 in all correspondence.  REVIEW OF THE EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST  CSC reserves the right to request additional information for clarification during the review of expressions of interest against this LOI.   THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION PROCESS  Suppliers are to note that this is not a tender process, nor a request for proposal. The issuance of this LOI does not create an obligation for CSC to issue or negotiate a subsequent contract, and does not bind CSC legally or otherwise to enter into a contract or to accept any suggestions from suppliers.  Canada is not bound to accept any expression of interest or to consider it further.   Changes to this LOI may occur and will be advertised on the Government Electronic Tendering Service. CSC asks suppliers to visit buyandsell.gc.ca regularly to check for changes, if any.  All inquiries and other communications related to this LOI should be directed to the Contracting Authority named above.","title":"Community Residential Facilities (21120-16-2222662)","trade_agreement":"None","id":9},{"GSIN_code":["5132A"],"URL":"https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tender-notice\/PW-NB-001-68955","buyer_contact":"Kelly, Patrick, (613) 716-5135 ( ), 11th Floor 800 Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque Boulevard West Montr\u00e9al Quebec H3B 1X9, 11th Floor 800 Ren\u00e9-L\u00e9vesque Boulevard West Montr\u00e9al Quebec H3B 1X9","buyer_name":"Transport Canada","closing_date":"2019-09-30 14:00:00-04:00","location_of_work":"Quebec","procurement_rules":"Suppliers on permanent list or able to meet qualification requirements","province_territory_of_work":["QC"],"published_date":"2016-02-01","selection_criteria":null,"tender_description":"Trade Agreement: WTO-AGP\/NAFTA\/AIT\/Canada FTAs with Peru\/Colombia\/Panama Tendering Procedures: Suppliers on permanent list or able to meet qualification requirements Competitive Procurement Strategy:  Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement: No Nature of Requirements:   LOI New Bridge for the St. Lawrence Corridor  Public Release of Project Agreement   This LOI is for information purposes only.

Engagement provides Industry with the opportunity to present their capabilities and considerations regarding Canada\u2019s requirements for a license to high-resolution optical satellite imagery to be accessed through the Web. Canada may use the information gathered to determine changes that should be included that will meet its needs and be consistent with Industry standard practices.   Respondents are invited to register and submit their responses to this RFI. Industry Engagement Questions are included with this RFI to provide Industry the opportunity to review and prepare written comments which may serve to facilitate this consultation process. The Rules of Engagement for this Industry Consultative Process can be found at Annex \u201cB\u201d, Engagement Participation Form.   2.0 Background   The Government of Canada has made continuous efforts over time to make national coverage of the most cost-effective optical satellite imagery available to all Canadians. In the past, images were made available through the National Landsat Mosaic (15m resolution, circa 2000), and a National SPOT 4\/5 data collection (10m resolution, circa 2007). Despite being out of date and of variable quality, these open datasets continue to be amongst the most highly utilized optical satellite datasets across Canada. The capabilities of next generation satellite sensors could greatly improve upon these national coverages.   Over the last several years, a collection of National Master Standing Offers (NMSOs) has been in place to facilitate the licensing of high resolution optical satellite imagery to Canada. These NMSOs have been used to acquire a large amount of satellite imagery with a significant coverage of Canada\u2019s landmass, albeit with a high degree of overlap.   Traditionally, imagery was acquired on an as-needed or as-requested basis, meaning each image was individually purchased. User needs have evolved over the last decade and many user communities require higher resolution imagery and modern access methods. This procurement seeks to meet these needs by making high resolution imagery available through a \u201csubscription-like\u201d procurement approach.   2.1 Requirement   The objective of the National Coverage Imagery (this procurement) is for Canada to acquire a licence to high-resolution optical satellite imagery covering the entire landmass of Canada accessed through the Web.   The National Coverage Imagery will be used by Canada\u2019s scientists, professionals and technicians. It will provide the intelligence required for evidence-based decision-making. Moreover, the implementation of the National Coverage Imagery will provide up-to-date and accurate imagery that will lead to a vast array of applications such as: detection and collection of key detailed land surface features (urban areas, transport\/energy networks, lakes and rivers, crop yield mapping), background imagery as well as multi-temporal analysis.   The Contractor must provide a National Coverage Imagery composed of Standard Imagery (high resolution optical satellite imagery) accessible through the following Web applications that are externally hosted and managed by the Contractor: a Web Portal, a Web Coverage Service and a Web Mapping Service. The Contractor must also provide a technical support in order to assist Canada on any aspect of the National Coverage Imagery.   Respondents are invited to consult Annex \u201cA\u201d, Industry Engagement Questions, and to request the most recent copy of the Draft Statement of Work for Industry Comments \u2013 Revision 2, as well as the applicable draft Request for Proposal (RFP) documents, by email from the Procurement Authority identified below, in order to provide their response(s) to the requested information.   All interested suppliers are encouraged to request the latest version of the draft Statement of Work and draft RFP documents, as many of the requirements have been updated since the previous version.   3.0 Registration Procedures   In order to participate in the Industry consultation process, Respondent(s) must complete, sign and return the Engagement Participation Form, along with its Appendices, which is included at Annex \u201cB\u201d of the RFI main document.   Registration for participation in the first round of this Industry Consultative Process or One\u2010on\u2010One Industry meeting was required on\/or before May 26, 2016.   Registration for participation in the second round of One\u2010on\u2010One Industry meetings was required on\/or before March 22, 2017.

PURPOSE  This Industry Consultation process seeks information from industry on its interest, capacity and ability to produce and deliver the systems that meet the requirements for the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Mercury Global (MG) Strategic Deployable Terminals (SDT). The Industry Consultation process provides industry the opportunity to give feedback on the procurement and In-Service Support (ISS) strategy and to solicit from industry feedback on their ability to support the MG SDT procurement and follow-on ISS.  The information gathered through this Industry Consultation process will be used by Canada to assist in the development of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the implementation of the MG SDT procurement.  2. BACKGROUND  The Department of National Defence (DND) has entered into an agreement with the United States (US) Department of Defence (DOD) and its allies, granting it access to the Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) system until 2031. The US requires that all terminals operatingon the WGS system be WGS certified by the US DOD. DND has recently announced a procurement and support contract to Design and Build (DAB), and provide ISS for seven MG Anchor Stations (AS) that will provide a point of entry for deployed MG SDTs to provide a National Rear Link (NRL) for Command and Control.  The goal of the SDT portion of the MG project is to procure Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) terminals that will be the in-theatre component of the NRL, connecting deployed Headquarters (HQ) with National HQ.  User terminals are outside the scope of the MG Project. User terminals are SATCOM terminals that are or will be used by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), Canadian Army (CA), Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), Canadian Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM), and other CAF operational user groups. They provide SATCOM links (commercial, WGS, or other military SATCOM links) between deployed units and their respective HQs (i.e. intra-theatre), or among deployed units in sub networks (i.e. tactical usage). The user terminals can be attached to mobile platforms such as ships, aircraft, and land vehicles, or even hand carried.   This RFI seeks to obtain a view of the prevailing market for Military Commercial off the Shelf (MILCOTS) X-band and Ka-band terminal products certified to operate over the WGS constellation. This is composed of a family of terminals along with training and ISS components in order to deliver a complete and comprehensive solution.  3. REQUIREMENTS  The following details highlight Canada's initial high-level vision of requirements for the Mercury Global SDT. As this RFI is the first step in engaging industry in the development and definition of the requirements, such requirements may be revised pending alternate solutions and discussions that take place during the RFI and any subsequent industry engagement process.  The SDT will be a suite of SATCOM terminals that provide a global Internet Protocol (IP) point of presence via the WGS constellation.DND seeks to fully support a variety of CAF missions via the WGS system through the purchase of three (3) different types of SDTs. The intent is to derive the three types from a similar technological family and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) in order to best utilize limited support resources. The MG constellation will allow the CAF to have a common fleet of SDTs that in turn provide it with a common training, operation and maintenance program, reducing costs over the life of the MG SDT program. The three types or sizes of SDTs address two key criteria; transportability and maximum WGS bandwidth efficiency.  4.  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION  The MG Project Team is seeking responses from industry for challenges involving the proposed acquisition strategy and delivery of the SDT contract. In turn, an Industry Day information session was scheduled to pose and address questions regarding this RFI.  Responses to this RFI were requested on or before 16 February 2015.  5. INDUSTRY DAY   The MG Project Team held an Industry Day information session to provide Industry with general information on the MG SDT procurement project, and obtain industry comments on the RFI. One-on-one meetings were held following the Industry Day information session. TheIndustry Day was held on 3 March 2015. The terms and conditions applicable to this engagement process are stated in Attachment 1 - Rules of Engagement Participation Agreement of the RFI.  In order to facilitate the one-on-one meetings, industry was encouraged to provide written comments and recommendations on the RFI as well as any additional topics industry wished to discuss.  Attendance at the Industry Day was not required in order to submit a response to any follow-on RFP.  6.   INDUSTRIAL ANDTECHNOLOGICAL BENEFITS  The Industrial and Regional Technological Benefits Policy, including Value Proposition may apply to these procurements. Vendors are encouraged to review the Value Proposition Guide, located on the Industry Canada website (http:\/\/www.ic.gc.ca\/eic\/site\/086.nsf\/eng\/h_00005.html), to familiarize themselves with the requirements.  Vendors were requested to provide a response to the following questions related to the Value Proposition criteria:  a.  Where do you see the economic opportunities for your company to undertake work directly related to these procurements?  b.  Are these areas of opportunity already established in Canada or do these areas require investment?  c.  To what extent would Canadian suppliers be able toparticipate directly in these areas of opportunity?  d.  How would work in the areas outlined above position you and your suppliers for future export opportunities?  e.  To what extent do you propose to undertake R&D activities related to this procurement? What would you anticipate will be the proportion of R&D activities performed internally or externally? Is there scope for post-secondary institutions to be involved?  f.  Other areas of economic opportunity: Where do you see strategic opportunities for Canada that could be leveraged as a result of these procurements in the defence sector or in other economic sectors?  7.  DRAFT DOCUMENTATION  Draft documentation was made available starting on 10 September 2015 in order to allow further questions and discussions regarding the requirement and enhance industry's contributions to the development of the RFP.  Participation in the Draft documentation process is not required in order to submit a response to any follow-on RFP.  8.

Suppliers may submit an arrangement for a specific configuration within each Group. Suppliers must however submit an arrangement for all items within the configuration for which an arrangement is submitted.  The Request for Supply Arrangements(RFSA) is to establish supply arrangements for the delivery of the requirement detailed in the RFSA to the Identified Users across Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs). Any requirement for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, or Labrador will have to be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the resulting supply arrangements.  A SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA. A SA is not a contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing a SA alone. The intent of a SA is to establish a framework to permit expeditious  processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for thegoods and services described in those bid solicitations.  All arrangements submitted under this Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) will be evaluated by Canada. An arrangement must comply with the requirements of the RFSA and meet all mandatory technical evaluation criteria to be declared responsive. All responsive arrangements will be recommended for issuance of a supply arrangement. Only suppliers who have been pre-qualified and have been awarded a SA will be allowed to submit bids for individual Request for Proposals  (RFPs).  The period of the RFSA will be for three (3) years from the date of issuance.  Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity for pre-qualification during the RFSA validity period. A continuous Notice will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service(GETS) to allow new Suppliers to become pre-qualified. Existing pre-qualified Suppliers, who have been issued a SA, will not be required to submit a new arrangement.

To solicit proposals for a particular requirement, Parks Canada will issue a Request for Proposal to suppliers from the List of Qualified Suppliers for Interpretive Writing (including Interpretive Planning). Suppliers must submit their proposals according to the instructions in each RFP. The proposals will be evaluated by Canada according to the method stated in the RFP.

Canada\u0092s Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) Policy, including the Value Proposition and the requirement for suppliers to place investment in Canada equal to the value of the contract(s), will apply to the FFCP. This procurement is subject to national security exception and is, therefore, excluded from all of the obligations of the trade agreements.  SUPPLIERS LIST INVITATION (SLI):  The Suppliers List Invitation (SLI) is a process for the creation of a Suppliers List. This SLI is not an invitation to submit proposals for the FFCP procurement process. No contract or bilateral\/ multilateral government agreement for the provision of advanced aircraft and associated elements will be awarded as a result of the activities under the SLI phase. This SLI has no defined closing date and will remain open until such time as Canada no longer considers it to be required. At that time, Canada will amend the letter of interest to reflect the actual SLI closing date. The FFCP competitive procurement process will require Government or a Defence Organisation (as applicable), and fighter aircraft Manufacturer involvement. As such, each Supplier on the Suppliers List will be composed of several entities, at a minimum a Government or a Defence Organisation (as applicable), and a fighter aircraft Manufacturer. The terms \"Supplier\", \"Government\", \"Defence Organisation\" and \"Manufacturer\" are defined terms for the purposes of the SLI (see article 2.1 of the SLI).   A complete response to the SLI consists of: a) Completed Annex A1 to the SLI-Government\/Defence Organisation Response Form; b) Completed Annex A2 to the SLI-Manufacturer Response Form; and c) Responses to the Suppliers List Criteria, Annex B to the SLI  Responses to the SLI may be submitted in either official language of Canada.

Applications may be submitted at any time during the period covered by this Letter of Interest (February 23, 2018 to December 30, 2022); however, please note that the timeframe of a particular fishery may limit the application period to be eligible to provide Logbooks and\/or Combined Forms to its participants. Suppliers should also be aware that the start date of the majority of fisheries is April 1st.   Once an applicant has been prequalified by DFO as a Logbook and\/or Combined Forms supplier, its contact information will be added to the current list of suppliers posted at www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca\/fm-gp\/sdc-cps\/nir-nei\/log-suppliers-eng.htm.  Qualification Process There are many different Logbooks and Combined Forms used by fish harvesters across Canada. The requirements of these forms must be in compliance with criteria specific to the regionally established licence conditions of each fishery. There may also be specific administrative requirements of the DFO Region responsible for processing these forms.  Suppliers may contact the Regional Logbooks Coordinators listed below to obtain required information pertaining to the Region-specific fishery of interest, including the applicable regional criteria, Logbooks and\/or Combined Forms templates or requirements, printing instructions or any other relevant documentation.   While DFO does not guarantee the number of forms that will be ordered by fish harvesters, where the information is available, approximations of the expected volume of orders for each Logbook and\/or Combined Forms will be provided to potential suppliers.  National Criteria  Interested suppliers should be aware of, and comply with, the following requirements in order to be prequalified by DFO as a Logbook and\/or Combined Forms supplier:  \u2022\tProvide a statement to the Department that confirms the company\u2019s capability to take orders by at least two of the following methods: e-mail, fax, website, or telephone. \u2022\tProvide a statement to the Department that confirms the company\u2019s capability to produce and deliver Logbooks and\/or Combined Forms to fish harvesters within six weeks of order. \u2022\tProvide public access, via website or upon request, to the price per unit for each of the documents the company intends to offer to a specific fishery. Please note that DFO retains the right to request this information as part of its qualification process, if needed.   \u2026\/2  \u2022\tProvide to the Department estimates of delivery costs. This may be based on a per-unit or bulk-order basis, as well as a rush\/emergency basis. \u2022\tProvide a statement to the Department that confirms the company\u2019s commitment to retain a minimal inventory of documents at all times to assure fish harvesters have access to additional or replacement Logbooks or Combined Forms during their fishing season. \u2022\tObtain prior written consent from the Department for any modifications to the Logbook and Combined Form templates. \u2022\tPrequalified logbook suppliers who did not receive notice of any major problems during the previous cycle (2015-2017) may roll over their Statement of Capabilities for the period covered by the current letter of interest (2018-2022). A new Statement of Capabilities may be requested if changes are required on the national or regional criteria, for operational or other reasons. Request for Proposal Publication A Request for Proposal will not follow this letter of interest as Fisheries and Oceans Canada will not be placing any orders as a result of this process.   Disclaimers \u2022\tFisheries and Oceans Canada in no way guarantees the number of forms that may be ordered by fish harvesters. \u2022\tPrequalification by Fisheries and Oceans Canada does not create any binding agreement or a contract between the company and the Department. \u2022\tIt is the sole discretion of Fisheries and Oceans Canada to determine whether an applicant meets the qualification requirements. \u2022\tPrequalification by Fisheries and Oceans Canada is for the fishing seasons from 2018 to 2022 only. It does not guarantee prequalification for subsequent years.  \u2022\tFailure to comply at any time with national or regional criteria, statements of capability and\/or commitments outlined above may result in the supplier being removed from Department\u2019s list of prequalified suppliers.

Revision 003 This revision is raised to modify Annex A - Purchase Description, Annex B - Technical Evaluation Matrix.   Revision 002 This revision is raised to publish questions and answers.   Revision 001 This revision is raised to modify the Request for Supply Arrangements.   Canada is seeking to establish Supply Arrangements (SA) to procure Articulating and Telescopic Boom Lifts, Self-Propelled Vertical Mast Lifts, and Self Propelled Scissor Lifts in accordance with Annex A - Purchase Description.  Suppliers may submit an arrangement for a specific configuration within each Group. Suppliers must however submit an arrangement for all items within the configuration for which an arrangement is submitted.  The Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) is to establish supply arrangements for the delivery of the requirement detailed in the RFSA to the Identified Users across Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs). Any requirement for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, or Labrador will have to be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the resulting supply arrangements.  An SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA. An SA is not a contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing an SA alone. The intent of an SA is to establish a framework to permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those bid solicitations.  All arrangements submitted under this Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) will be evaluated by Canada. An arrangement must comply with the requirements of the RFSA and meet all mandatory technical evaluation criteria to be declared responsive. All responsive arrangements will be recommended for issuance of a supply arrangement. Only suppliers who have been pre-qualified and have been awarded an SA will be allowed to submit bids for individual Request for Proposals (RFPs).  The period of the RFSA will be for three (3) years from the date of issuance.  Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity for pre-qualification during the RFSA validity period. A continuous Notice will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) to allow new Suppliers to become pre-qualified. Existing pre-qualified Suppliers, who have been issued a SA, will not be required to submit a new arrangement. The existing pre-qualified Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity during the RFSA validity period to qualify new products.  The Crown retains the right to negotiate with suppliers on any procurement.    Delivery Date: 01\/06\/2018  The Crown retains the right to negotiate with suppliers on any procurement.

When the price or availability of submitted products changes, suppliers should re-submit updated information on their respective syndicated studies. Accordingly, for suppliers that submitted information in fiscal year 2018-2019 (i.e., between April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019 inclusively), we suggest that they submit updated information or make PSPC aware whether there are any new studies, or studies that are no longer available.   The Public Opinion Research Directorate (PORD) of Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) coordinates public opinion research (POR) activities for the Government of Canada (GC).  On behalf of the GC, PORD is seeking information on public opinion research* syndicated studies that are available for purchase with a government-wide subscription. For the sake of clarity, this is how PORD describes syndicated research to federal government clients: Syndicated research studies are off the shelf products produced by the private sector on a range of societal and government-specific topics (e.g. social media usage, youth, etc.) for paying subscribers. Costs and the results of these studies are shared only among subscribers for a fixed period of time, often in the form of reports, presentations, raw data, etc. Unlike custom research where the Government of Canada determines the research content and retains the intellectual property, the suppliers who produce syndicated studies retain copyright and sole responsibility for managing the content.  PORD defines \"government-wide subscription\" as: The information and deliverables from each study will be shared within the federal public administration; this includes all departments, as defined in section 2 of the Financial Administration Act, and all divisions, branches and other portions of the federal public administration listed in schedules III, IV, V, and VI of the Financial Administration Act.  The GC is principally interested in studies that may provide relevant information to assist and support a large number of government programs, and not duplicate existing custom research. Only studies submitted in the Request for Information (RFI) process will be considered for purchase. Suppliers can submit information about syndicated products on any topic area. Preference may be given to GC priority areas.   The GC is in search of the most economical means of accessing research on these broad issues. Consequently, this RFI solicits detailed information on syndicated research studies.   Each syndicated study will be considered based on whether it meets the needs of GC departments, whether there is sufficient interest and available budget, whether it provides sufficient value, and whether it is the most cost-effective research option available. Only studies offering a government-wide subscription will be considered.   Please note: The GC is under no obligation to proceed with the purchase of a subscription to any of the syndicated research studies for which information is received**. If and when subscriptions are to be obtained, PORD will act as the coordinator on behalf of the GC and the Communications Procurement Directorate will act as the contracting authority.   RESPONSE SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS   All submissions must demonstrate the high quality of the research products being presented for consideration and the value-for-money they offer. Submissions should contain (at minimum) the following details:   1. the title of the study;  2. an overview of the topics covered, including questions and\/or specific areas\/issues addressed in the research;  a. please note: Syndicated research studies must not contain information regarding electoral voting intentions, or political party preferences or party standings with the electorate; 3. the target population(s) covered;  4. a breakdown of the methodology(ies) used.  In the case of qualitative research: research techniques, research frequency, recruiting methods, recruiting sources, geographic locations, etc., and, in the case of quantitative research: research techniques, sample size and breakdown by region, survey duration, frequency of surveys, sample source (probability or non-probability) as well as any other pertinent information, etc.;  5. details of the language(s) used in data collection;  6. suppliers should indicate whether a previous iteration of the syndicated study was conducted. Please also include information on the availability of previously-collected data for tracking purposes, if applicable; 7. the deliverables;  a. indicate what deliverables are included in the price (e.g. final report, data tables, raw data file (SPSS\/Excel etc.), presentation). At minimum the deliverables should include 2 presentations, and accompanying presentation deck in one of the official languages;  b. planned timeline should be included (e.g. tentative field and deliverable dates); 8. cost; a. a total cost with and without HST (as a government-wide subscription). Also note that cost proposals should include, at minimum, two presentations (via web\/video conference) to the GC on the research findings, and accompanying presentation deck;   b. a total cost if the same project were to be done as a custom study for the GC;  c. suppliers should provide a separate cost for the translation into the other official language (with and without HST) of the final presentation deck separate from the cost of the overall syndicated study; d. suppliers should also provide a separate cost (with and without HST) for a fully web accessible*** version of the final presentation deck in HTML 5.0. 9. Permission; a. The GC is seeking advanced permission to share all of the information provided in the submission with interested GC departments. Please ensure to indicate if you agree to this in the submission template.  Because this is not a bid solicitation, the GC will not necessarily respond to enquiries in writing or by circulating answers to all suppliers. However, suppliers with questions regarding this RFI may direct their enquiries to paola.amaral@pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca.   RESPONSES  GC intends to accept responses to this RFI on a continuous basis. Submissions received will be periodically reviewed based on GC requirements and internal resource availability. The information in this notice will be updated on an ongoing basis through the issuance of an RFI amendment on buyandsell.gc.ca.  As departments typically develop their annual POR plans near the beginning of each fiscal year, suppliers are strongly encouraged to submit their information before the end of June each year. If the price or availability of submitted products changes, suppliers should re-submit updated information on their respective syndicated studies.    Responses should be submitted directly to Paola Amaral at paola.amaral@pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca. Responses should include the RFI Submission Template provided below. Although it is not a requirement, suppliers can also include a prospectus in addition to the completed RFI Submission Template.   Canada retains the right to negotiate with suppliers on any procurement.  Documents may be submitted in either official language of Canada.   * Definition of Public Opinion Research - https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/treasury-board-secretariat\/services\/government-communications\/public-opinion-research-government.html  ** The issuance of this RFI does not create an obligation for the GC to issue a solicitation or contract, and does not bind the GC legally or otherwise, to enter into any agreement with the respondents. The GC reserves the right to cancel or modify any of the preliminary requirements described herein.  *** Standard on Web Accessibility - https:\/\/www.tbs-sct.gc.ca\/ws-nw\/wa-aw\/index-eng.asp   ***********************************************************   FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:    1.  Is this opportunity exclusively for companies on the Standing Offer or is it open to others?  This opportunity is not exclusive to Standing Offer holders and any supplier with a syndicated research study may submit a response.    2. Do RFI submissions have to use the exact Word template provided, or can we use a branded PowerPoint template as long as it includes all the required information?  Although we prefer that the template be used, suppliers can submit the information in any format as long as the information is included.    3. I was wondering about having a web-ready copy of the report available if the study is not intended for public use but rather for internal use only.  Would this still be required?  Although it is not shared publicly, as its government-wide it is shared to all GC departments through our intranet (internally), and has to be accessible for employees.   4. What is meant by key areas of interest?  Key areas of interest, the 3rd item indicted on the RFI Submission Template refers to the topic, subject area, or key areas of interest in the suppliers syndicated product.   5. When you say target population, are you referring to the group(s) or stakeholders that are being surveyed or are you talking about who would be interested in accessing this information contained in the survey?  Target population refers to the population and sub populations being surveyed.   6. Can we submit copies of the templates for the Syndicated Studies electronically or do you require a hard copy of each study template by the due date?  Electronic copies are accepted, and are preferred as per the Government of Canada Greening Initiatives.    7. In the past, some syndicated products purchased by the Government of Canada had a variety of features, including core questions available to all subscribers and proprietary questions available to subscribers on a per question purchase basis. Is this approach in line with current thinking regarding syndicated research studies and this RFI?  The RFI is meant for the purchase of syndicated research. In circumstances where  studies allow for the inclusion of additional questions generated by the Government of Canada, it will be treated through a separate contract.  These client based\/ omnibus questions will be treated as custom research and the results will be made available to the public through the Library and Archives of Canada Website.  A methodology report along with the data table(s) will be required. The cost of any client-based questions and methodology report should be identified separately.    8. In terms of section viii (cost) d. which refers to a fully web accessible version of the final presentation, can you confirm that this web accessible version is intended for internal Government of Canada use only and not intended to be made public on any Government of Canada website or other source? If there is an intent to make it public, is there a delay period before public release (for example, would it be made available one year after initial publication)? Likewise, are all other deliverables (reports, tables, and so forth) intended for Government of Canada internal use only or would they be made public  Web accessible versions of the final presentations are only intended for internal Government of Canada use and will not be made public.   9. Could you please clarify what is required for \"custom study cost\" (Item 8b) in the template, and how this information will be used\/why it is needed?   We are hoping for further insight into what you are looking for here. Since there always needs to be a business case to run a syndicated study, in terms of the subscription price (i.e., getting enough subscribers to offset the project cost), it is unclear what is the relevance of a custom study cost.   A \"custom study cost\" refers to the cost the supplier would charge for the study if it was done as an individual project where the Government of Canada was the sole client.  Custom studies are ones where the Government of Canada (GC) would determine the content and retain the copyright.    As indicated in the RFI \"the GC is in search of the most economical means of accessing research\". The GC will use the information on \"custom study cost\" to compare the cost of purchasing a syndicated study subscription with the cost of undertaking a custom study.    10. We have a question about how to properly respond to Section 8(A), 8(D) and 8(E) in the Syndicated Research Studies RFI submission.  As we have no prior experience to draw upon, we are not sure how to properly quote for licensing costs and the cost for web accessibility.  Would it be acceptable to leave these sections 8 a,d,e blank so that they could be discussed and quoted properly at a later time should there be interest to proceed with the research?  Yes, sections 8d, 8e can be left blank. However, for \"section 8a\", a price will have to be provided before Public Services and Procurement Canada can make the submission available to departments. Public Services and Procurement Canada may contact suppliers to obtain this information after this RFI closes.  Delivery Date: Above-mentioned  The Crown retains the right to negotiate with suppliers on any procurement.  Documents may be submitted in either official language of Canada.","title":"SYNDICATED RESEARCH STUDIES (EP363-190460\/B)","trade_agreement":"None, None","id":55},{"GSIN_code":["E110A","C118A","AH115032","R019UB","M240A","AT919500","C211D","H900A"],"URL":"https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tender-notice\/PW-18-00837782","buyer_contact":"Foster, Steven, Steven.Foster@dcc-cdc.gc.ca, 613-392-2811 ext 4161","buyer_name":"Defence Construction Canada","closing_date":"2020-03-31 14:00:00-04:00","location_of_work":"Aboriginal Lands, Nunavut","procurement_rules":"Open","province_territory_of_work":["NU"],"published_date":"2018-08-03","selection_criteria":null,"tender_description":"Advance Procurement Notice     Environmental Program FY 2018-2020      CFS Alert & Eureka, Nunavut     (with Security Requirements)     Purpose of this Advance Procurement Notice    This is not a bid solicitation. This is an advance notice of potential projects with anticipated security requirements to provide interested Consultants an opportunity to apply for security clearances. Note that there is no guarantee that these projects will proceed.    Description of the Project and Services    The purpose of the work is to identify historical and\/or current areas of potential environmental concern (APECs), Areas of Concerns (AECs) and potential contaminants of concerns (COCs) based on a review of available historical information, data gap analysis, site visits and interviews, and develop a conceptual site model (CSM) that depicts site conditions both present and past, potential sources of contamination, migration pathways and potential receptors.   The Consultant Program will consist of desktop studies, site reconnaissance and environmental field programs. The program may include, but is not limited to environmental assessment, risk assessment and environmental remediation. Additional technical services supporting the program may also include, but not be limited to, land surveying, materials testing, geotechnical and environmental studies.\u00a0   Overall program value is estimated at $5,000,000.00, with the maximum value of any individual project estimated at $2,000,000.00.

Suppliers may submit an arrangement for a specific configuration. Suppliers must however submit an arrangement for all items within the configuration for which an arrangement is submitted.  The Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) is to establish supply arrangements for the delivery of the requirement detailed in the RFSA to the Identified Users across Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs).  Any requirement for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, or Labrador will have to be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the resulting supply arrangements.  A SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA.  A SA is not a contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing a SA alone. The intent of a SA is to establish a framework to permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those bid solicitations.  All arrangements submitted under this Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) will be evaluated by Canada.  An arrangement must comply with the requirements of the RFSA and meet all mandatory technical evaluation criteria to be declared responsive. All responsive arrangements will be recommended for issuance of a supply arrangement. Only suppliers who have been pre-qualified and have been awarded a SA will be allowed to submit bids for individual Request for Proposals (RFPs).  The period of the RFSA will be for three (3) years from the date of issuance.  Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity for pre-qualification during the RFSA validity period. A continuous Notice will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service(GETS) to allow new Suppliers to become pre-qualified. Existing pre-qualified Suppliers, who have been issued a SA, will not be required to submit a new arrangement. The existing pre-qualified Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity during the RFSA validity period to qualify new products.

This industry consultation process provides industry the opportunity to provide feedback in the development and refinement of the requirement, including the proposed technical requirement, the procurement strategy and methods of leveraging economic benefit for Canada.   The information gathered through this industry consultation process may be used by Canada to assist in the development of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the implementation of the SofS 2 procurement. As such, the requirement may be revised pending alternate solutions and discussions that take place during all industry engagement processes.  BACKGROUND  The Canadian Armed Forces rely heavily on space-based assets to conduct operations. The space environment is increasingly congested due to the dramatic increase in commercial and other satellites and debris. Potential adversaries also possess increasingly sophisticated anti-satellite weapons. In the context of this environment, access to Space Situational Awareness (SSA) helps ensure the security and integrity of national space-based capabilities, the awareness of space threats to Canadian territory, and support to Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) operations worldwide. In 2013, the Department of National Defence (DND) and the CAF launched their first military satellite, Sapphire, a Space Based Optical (SBO) sensor that provides valuable Space Situational Awareness to both Canada and its allies. SSA products allow Canada to accurately assess the orbital positions and projected paths of our space assets. Surveillance of Space 2 (SofS 2) offers Canada the opportunity to build on the performance of Sapphire and to continue Canada\u0092s status as a valuable contributor to the US owned and operated Space Surveillance Network (SSN) and enjoy guaranteed access to the SSN. The preferred capability for the SofS 2 solution is Optical and may include a Ground Based Optical (GBO), SBO (which may include multiples) or a combination of both GBO and SBO(s); an enduring SSA capability that provides best value for cost is a key consideration for DND.   For further background information please see the attached Request for Information (RFI) document.  Requirement  Please refer to the RFI document for details.   The Procurement Process   REQUEST FOR INFORMATION  This RFI is released to Industry to engage industry and socialize the requirements of SofS2 while soliciting feedback from industry to assess procurement and implementation options.    Responses to this RFI are requested on or before 15 September 2018.  E-mail responses are acceptable.  Submission of a response to this RFI is not required in order to submit a response to any follow-on RFP.  INDUSTRY DAY  The SofS 2 Project Team intends to hold an Industry Day information session to provide companies with general information of the SofS 2 project and obtain initial industry comments on the RFI.  One-on-one meetings with interested companies will be held following the Industry day information session.  Industry Day will be held in Gatineau, Quebec on 28 August 2018 with one-on-one meetings to follow the Industry Day and continue through 29 August 2018.    In order to participate in the Industry Day and one-on-one meetings, interested companies must sign and return the Rules of Engagement document, available when requested by interested suppliers.

Please note that vendors can subscribe to tender notice updates (RSS, ATOM, e-mail) using the keyword \"HRP-RHP\".   Introduction  Canadas public servants deserve to be paid properly and on time for their important work. Stabilizing the Government of Canadas (GoC) current pay system (Phoenix) remains a top priority and continues to be carried out by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) and Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) integrated team.  While recent information indicates the current pay system is showing some signs of stabilizing, a longer-term, sustainable, end-to-end solution needs to be explored for an HR and pay solution.  As outlined in Budget 2018, in addition to Stabilizing Phoenix, the GoC is committing to the next steps in addressing the ongoing challenges of the Phoenix pay system, including its intention to move to a next generation solution; one that will be better aligned with the complexity of the federal governments HR and pay structure.  The Phoenix issues have shown that HR and pay are mutually dependent and don't exist in isolation.  The next generation solution may therefore also support the full hire-to-retire employee lifecycle, enabling the GoC to better attract, pay, retain and nurture its employees.  This solution may cover aspects such as: recruitment, training, performance management and other HR processes and systems, and interdependencies with pay, and any other downstream systems like pension and receiver general.  The GoC is committed to exploring all options, and will be working with experts, unions, public servants, and technology providers to address the current pay challenges as well as define the way forward.  In particular, we are committed to working in partnership with our bargaining agents and system users at the centre of this process.  The GoC will consider the lessons learned and best practices from the implementation of large-scale initiatives from other jurisdictions.  Stabilization efforts are absolutely critical and will continue as the GoC works towards options for this Next Generation HR and pay solution.  The following information therefore relates to two distinct projects currently identified as priorities for the GoC:  1. Stabilization of the Phoenix pay system and related pay activities led by PSPC, through collaboration with the integrated team; 2. Next Generation HR and pay solution (people, technology, and processes)  led by TBS on behalf of the GoC.    A. Nature of Requirement   The GoC is calling on private sector vendors to provide information and potential solutions to a variety of Enterprise-wide business challenges and needs associated with both stabilization and a Next Generation HR and Pay solution.  This Notice:   Communicates that the GoC may establish pre-qualified lists of suppliers to address HR and Pay challenges; and  Identifies categories for which the GoC may be seeking information and potential solution proposals.  The following describes areas of work that the GoC will be seeking information and proposals.  This list may evolve with amendments, additions, or deletions.  1) Stabilization:   a. Lowering the Queue\/Backlog: The GoC is seeking innovative approaches to processing outstanding pay-related tickets in order to accelerate the close-rate.  b. Training: The GoC is seeking training solutions to rapidly develop and deploy new training materials, deliver training products, and measure the effectiveness of the training. The solution should have the ability to assess how the training materials contribute to improved user productivity.   c. Automation of Pay Centre Processes: Serving over 200,000 clients, the Pay Centre in Miramichi receives approximately 1.3 million requests for service annually.  Many of these requests result in compensation agents at the Pay Centre having to perform some level of manual processing to complete the transaction. The GoC is seeking innovative approaches and solutions to automate some of these manual transactions, which can also be extended to pay processing in other Departments and Agencies.  d. Improving User Experience: A number of studies have identified that the usability of pay systems and processes needs to improve. Users, and particularly employees and managers, are experiencing a sense of powerlessness and frustration because interactions related to pay are spread across multiple channels, do not always provide requested information and are not sufficiently responsive. Canada is seeking innovative approaches to improve the user experience.  e. Automation of System User Access Management: Current user-access management processes are paper-based causing delays to employees access to HR and Pay systems.  The GoC is seeking assistance to automate these processes in the current Phoenix pay system, while retaining necessary controls.  f. HR Processes: The design of the Phoenix system requires that data be fed from HR systems into the Phoenix system or directly entered into Phoenix by compensation advisors. The various HR Systems interfacing with the Phoenix Pay System have different architectures and different front end system edits which have a direct influence on the quality of the HR data being transmitted to Phoenix and ultimately on the pay cheque of employees. Over the course of the last two years while operating the new Phoenix payroll system and the new consolidated compensation process operation, the Government of Canada has identified HR Process Transformation as an area that requires strengthening in order to stabilize and subsequently optimize its HR-to-Pay process. Canada is seeking innovative approaches to effectively and efficiently perform HR functions that have led to positive downstream payroll implications and will directly contribute to system stabilization.     2) Next Generation HR and Pay Solution:  a. Discovery and Design Thinking: The GoC continues to learn and adopt leading human-centered design & service design best practices that can shape the vision and inform decisions across all aspects of the project (people, technology, processes).  The GoC may seek expert assistance in conducting user research and engaging GoC employees, HR practitioners, compensation advisors and\/or unions to further understand who the users are, what are their goals and expectations, and how the new service should meet those needs.  b. Digital Business Optimization and Architecture: As employee and citizen expectations rise and businesses deliver digital-based and better services across all industry sectors, the GoC recognizes the need to rethink the way it works. The GoC may seek expert assistance in conducting an end-to-end review of business capabilities, business outcomes, business requirements and business processes, potentially resulting in improvements to service models and pay operations, improved training, reporting, interactions, etc.   c. Innovative technology solutions: As digital concepts are releasing more personalized employee, supplier, and partner experiences through the use of mobility, self-service, cloud, in-memory databases, embedded analytics, etc., GoC employees expect and demand that innovation be also reflected in their interactions with government so that GoC employees can take full advantage.  Consequently, the GoC may seek expert assistance to evaluate and fully utilize innovative solutions, industry best practices and technological advancements are embedded into the GoCs future.  d. Change Management: The GoC recognizes that change management should be a priority throughout the life of any high risk, complex transformation initiative and is fundamental to ensure business outcomes are met. The GoC may seek expert assistance to ensure individuals, teams, and organizations are prepared and supported to successfully execute the organizational change.  e. Program Management & Capacity: The GoC recognizes that oversight and strategic direction is critical to ensure the desired outcomes are reached and benefits realized. The GoC may seek a strategic partnership(s) to supplement the Next Generation Project teams capacity to plan for transformation to digital services and platforms based on their understanding of industry best practices, methodologies, implementation strategies, etc. Any strategic partner(s) would not be allowed to bid on the future business, technology, or implementation services related to any Next Generation HR and Pay solution.  In all applicable areas above, the GoC requires all solutions to be accessible by default, include security and privacy by design, and leverage the use of cloud services first (in alignment with the Policy on Management of IT, secured in accordance with the Direction on the Secure Use of Commercial Cloud Services).  Please note GoC pay stabilization efforts have been ongoing since 2016, and GoC Next Generation HR and Pay solution efforts started earlier in 2018.  Therefore some private sector vendors have already been engaged and some standing procurement vehicles are already in place, which have helped the GoC begin work in some of the categories highlighted above.  Existing vehicles will continue to be leveraged as appropriate, and any information gathered to date will serve as foundational as the GoC looks to address, as required, all of the areas outlined in this notice.  B. Context  The Pay Modernization Project replaced the Regional Pay System with a PeopleSoft based payroll system, an application that eventually came to be called Phoenix.  Since pay crisis emerged in spring 2016, it has been obvious that the outcomes have been unacceptable for both the Government and its employees.  The Pay Consolidation Project consolidated the compensation function, which resided within each GoC department and agency, under PSPC and included the location in Miramichi, New Brunswick.  Today, 44 departments representing approximately 200,000 civil servants are provided with compensation services based out of the Miramichi Pay Centre.   The GoC has worked with its own subject matter experts and suppliers alike to deploy improvements to ensure employees are paid accurately and on time.   Since pay crisis emerged in spring 2016, the on-going difficulties with the implementation of the pay system triggered a decision, as documented in Budget 2018, to begin investigating the development of the next generation of the federal governments HR and pay systems.   C. Procurement Framework   As part of its effort to streamline the procurement process and improve business outcomes, with a focus on agility and dialogue with interested vendors, the GoC plans to engage industry as follows.  1. The GoC recognizes the diversity of industry, which may range from vertically integrated vendors, start-ups, and long established corporate entities.  2. The purpose of the proposed procurement is to allow the Government of Canada, as an enterprise, to rapidly access, pre-qualified suppliers that can provide innovative solutions to a variety of business challenges  Canada may put forth relating to all aspects of the HR-to-Pay environment and its related services. 3. Any proposed procurement will be processed through the PSPC or TBS procurement authority potentially using a wide range of procurement tools. 4. As an initial step, the GoC anticipates sharing more information on the problem to be solved and solicit information from industry with the intention of using the feedback to determine how to best proceed and use the various procurement options the GoC has at its disposal.   5. The GoC will work with suppliers in a collaborative fashion to the greatest extent possible and an iterative approach may be used to incorporate feedback from both stakeholders and industry. As such, the GoC also intends to qualify firms in various workstreams which would subsequently be invited to compete either in an expedited way or through an agile iterative approach. 6. As part of the collaborative process, suppliers must be prepared to offer a sandbox environment to the GoC at no charge to demonstrate functionality and facilitate evaluation.    7. The GoC may employ a variety of procurement tools to solicit industry response to this Notice.  Canada anticipates that it may use Requests for Information (RFI), Letters of Interest (LOI), Invitations to Qualify (ITQ), Requests for Proposals (RFP), Requests for Supply Arrangement (RFSA) and\\or other methods to meet its needs. 8. Suppliers should be aware that initiating a business solution in response to a procurement request may not result in the solution being selected for implementation. 9. The GoC remains open to solutions put forth both internally by its own subject matter experts and externally from innovators that may complement work already undertaken or planned.  D. Approach and Timelines   As part of its effort to streamline the procurement process and reduce dwell times along the procurement continuum with a focus on agility and dialogues with interested vendors, the GoC plans to engage industry as follows:  1. Start publishing RFIs on www.buyandsell.gc.ca in September 2018, outlining specific business problems and to establish lists of qualified suppliers to address HR-to-Pay issues.  2. Industry consultation(s) as required (industry day and\/or one-on-one meetings). 3. Establish a list of pre-qualified suppliers via RFSA or ITQ or other processes such as an iterative agile procurement (fall 2018). 4. Compete amongst pre-qualified suppliers (if required) (starting fall 2018). 5. Award contract(s) as deemed appropriate. 6. Periodic refresh of qualified supplier lists and\/or refresh the list of workstreams.  The exact approach and timelines may vary per workstream (business challenge and service requested).  *To receive an email notification for new amendments, select the email notification service icon   and fill out the subscription form on the Page of Notice.

Introduction  Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) is initiating a review of the Task-Based Informatics Professional Services (TBIPS) Method of Supply   2. Background  The Task-Based Informatics Professional Services (TBIPS) Method of Supply was established in December 2007 by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC). The resulting Supply Arrangements (SAs) and Standing Offers (SOs) were established as part of the Way Forward Initiative and aimed to address the objectives of reducing the procurement process time in half, achieving additional savings on the cost of the services purchased and the procurement activities as well as improving the commodity management aspect.  The TBIPS SAs and SOs were established as one government-wide mandatory procurement vehicle for informatics professional services and ensured that all suppliers across Canada \u0096 both large and small - had fair, simple and open access to government procurement activities. Over the years, the TBIPS Method of Supply has grown to 7 streams of service to a large number of resource categories (93) and, while the qualifying criteria remained the same all along, it currently has in excess of 450 pre-qualified suppliers, including both Indigenous and non-Indigenous suppliers. An on-line application called the Centralized Professional Services System was developed to allow suppliers to manage their profiles and to submit their applications.  TBIPS is refreshed on a quarterly basis to intake new suppliers and to allow existing suppliers to qualify for new categories of services.  As part of the Government of Canada\u0092s commitment to modernizing procurement, PSPC is committed to modernizing procurement practices so they are simpler, less administratively burdensome, and encourage greater competition. Recently, both suppliers and government departments have expressed their willingness to support a review process of the TBIPS Method of Supply. In support of the Government of Canada\u0092s commitment to modernizing procurement, PSPC is initiating this review to ensure the Method of Supply is simpler, less administratively burdensome and encourages greater competition. This review will focus on maximizing its efficiency, where possible, and including considerations for more current trends and priorities.    3. Purpose  The main purpose of this Letter of Interest (LOI) is to inform Industry and government departments of the steps being taken and how any and all parties wishing to participate or provide feedback can do so.   The first publication serves to notify all potential stakeholders (i.e. clients, suppliers, procurement organizations) of Canada\u0092s intentions to examine the current TBIPS procurement process.   It is also to seek information from those stakeholders on their interest and willingness to review and collaborate to mature the TBIPS Method of Supply.   PSPC is proposing that, in order to devise and implement any recommended solution, a consultative approach be applied to gather and process the information that be provided by all participants.   Please review this LOI from time to time as it will be updated frequently.   4. Enquiries  Because this is not a bid solicitation, Canada will not necessarily respond to enquiries in writing or by circulating answers to all potential suppliers. However, respondents with questions regarding this LOI may direct their enquiries to:  Contracting Authority: John Headon  E-mail Address:  RCNMDAI-NCRIMOS@pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca Telephone:  613-854-5673  Delivery Date: Above-mentioned  The Crown retains the right to negotiate with suppliers on any procurement.

As part of its continuous effort to make it easier for Suppliers to do business with Canada, through this refresh, Canada is making SAs valid from date of SA issuance until such time as Canada no longer deems them necessary.  Suppliers continued compliance to the SA requirement will be validated on a regular basis at the discretion of the SA Authority through the Evergreen Certification.   Refresh qualification opportunities for Suppliers will remain, enabling New Bidders to qualify and Existing Suppliers to qualify for additional Streams.  LIST OF STREAMS  This RFSA includes five Streams:  Stream 1:  Human Resource Services; Stream 2:  Business Services \/ Change Management Services;  Stream 3:  Project Management Services;  Stream 4:  Real Property Project Management Services; and  Stream 5:  Technical Engineering and Maintenance Services (TEMS)  All five Streams will be structured according to the following Tiers:  Tier 1:  Requirements up to and including $2 million (GST\/HST included); Tier 2:  Requirements greater than $2 million (GST\/HST included).  Solutions based professional services are services that are not related to a particular activity or initiative; they are requirements where Identified Users require options on how to resolve a business problem.

Background    The Department of National Defence (DND) moves materiel and personnel domestically and internationally on an as required basis to support operations. DND accomplishes this task primarily through its own means but also contracts directly with Industry for the movement of personnel and cargo by airlift, and cargo by sea charter or freight forwarding for some multi-modal movements. To contract for transportation requirements that arise, DND maintains multiple Source Lists of pre-qualified service providers and brokers.    2. Source List Renewal    DND\u2019s  2016 Transportation Source Lists  expire November 18, 2018. As such, DND is soliciting industry applications to renew each of these Source Lists.

Revision 001 This revision is raised to publish question and answers and to provide revised annexes.   Canada is seeking to establish Supply Arrangements (SA) to procure to procure Agricultural Tractors, various configurations and ancillary items in accordance with Annex A - Purchase Description.  Suppliers may submit an arrangement for a specific configuration. Suppliers must however submit an arrangement for all items within the configuration for which an arrangement is submitted.  The Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) is to establish supply arrangements for the delivery of the requirement detailed in the RFSA to the Identified Users across Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs). Any requirement for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, or Labrador will have to be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the resulting supply arrangements.  An SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA. An SA is not a contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing an SA alone. The intent of an SA is to establish a framework to permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those bid solicitations.  All arrangements submitted under this Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) will be evaluated by Canada. An arrangement must comply with the requirements of the RFSA and meet all mandatory technical evaluation criteria to be declared responsive. All responsive arrangements will be recommended for issuance of a supply arrangement. Only suppliers who have been pre-qualified and have been awarded an SA will be allowed to submit bids for individual Request for Proposals (RFPs).  The period of the RFSA will be for three (3) years from the date of issuance.  Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity for pre-qualification during the RFSA validity period. A continuous Notice will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) to allow new Suppliers to become pre-qualified. Existing pre-qualified Suppliers, who have been issued a SA, will not be required to submit a new arrangement. The existing pre-qualified Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity during the RFSA validity period to qualify new products.

Introduction and Procurement Approach    Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) is issuing a Call for Proposals (CFP) on behalf of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), seeking innovative solutions to address a wide range of challenges facing federal departments and agencies.   The Innovative Solutions Canada Program (ISC) is designed to support the development of early-stage, pre-commercial innovations by small businesses that have no more than 499 employees and demonstrate the capacity to develop an innovative solution.   Challenges issued under the ISC CFP will be published on an ongoing basis and will be listed on this page. Details related to each challenge will be published in separate challenge notices.  For each Challenge, proposals must be submitted by the closing date and time indicated on the tender notice page for that individual Challenge.    All information related to Proposal Submission, Evaluation Procedures and Basis of Selection are contained in the CFP solicitation document.    Innovative Solutions Canada Program Overview    The ISC program is a multi-stage program that seeks solutions to challenges that start at the earliest levels of technology development.    Phase 1: Proof of Concept    Eligible small businesses:     Must enter the program at Phase 1   Must propose a solution starting at  technology readiness levels  (TRLs) 1-4 (inclusive)   May receive a contract for up to $150,000 and a maximum of 6 months to develop and deliver a proof of concept.  The maximum funding and duration are identified in each Challenge Notice.        Phase 2: Prototype Development    Eligible small businesses that successfully complete Phase 1:    May receive a contract for up to $1,000,000 and a maximum of two years to develop their solution beyond the proof of concept with the goal of developing and delivering of a prototype.  The maximum funding and duration are identified in each Challenge Notice.       Important Note:  On a case-by-case basis, the Department of National Defence will be allowed to spend outside of the limits and timelines noted in Phases 1 and 2.  The maximum funding and duration are identified in each Challenge Notice.     Phase 3: Creating a Pathway to   Commercialization     Based on the success of the prototype developed in previous phases, a federal department or agency may choose to fund additional research & development and\/or procure the novel technology or service from the Canadian small business through a separate procurement process.    ISC Program Eligibility     Successful small businesses will be required to certify eligibility before entering Phase 1. Re-certification is required prior to entering Phase 2.   Eligible small businesses under the ISC program are those that meet all of the following criteria:     for profit   incorporated in Canada (federally or provincially)   499 or fewer full-time equivalent (FTE) employees*   research and development activities that take place in Canada   50% or more of its annual wages, salaries and fees are currently paid to employees and contractors who spend the majority of their time working in Canada*   50% or more of its FTE employees have Canada as their ordinary place of work*   50% or more of its senior executives (Vice President and above) have Canada as their principal residence*     * Calculations must take into account and include affiliated businesses, such as parent companies and subsidiaries that are either in or outside of Canada.   Under the Innovative Solutions Canada program, an \"affiliate\" relationship exists in the following situations:     An affiliate is a corporation that is a subsidiary of another corporation   If a corporation has two subsidiary corporations, the two subsidiaries are affiliates of each other; or   If two corporations are controlled by the same individual or business, the two corporations are also affiliates of each other.     A subsidiary is understood to be a business which has more than 50% of its ordinary shares or voting power owned by another business or individual.

The Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) is to establish supply arrangements for the delivery of the requirement detailed in the RFSA to the Identified Users across Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs). Any requirement for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, or Labrador will have to be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the resulting supply arrangements.  An SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA. An SA is not a contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing an SA alone. The intent of an SA is to establish a framework to permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those bid solicitations. All arrangements submitted under this Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) will be evaluated by Canada. An arrangement must comply with the requirements of the RFSA and meet all mandatory technical evaluation criteria to be declared responsive. All responsive arrangements will be recommended for issuance of a supply arrangement. Only suppliers who have been pre-qualified and have been awarded an SA will be allowed to submit bids for individual Request for Proposals (RFPs). Suppliers that are already qualified for Supply Arrangement E60HS-17MOWR, will automatically be qualified for the group 1 arrangement for Supply Arrangement E60HS-18MOWR. The period of the RFSA will be for three (3) years from the date of issuance. Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity for pre-qualification during the RFSA validity period. A continuous Notice will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) to allow new Suppliers to become pre-qualified. Existing pre-qualified Suppliers, who have been issued a SA, will not be required to submit a new arrangement. The existing pre-qualified Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity during the RFSA validity period to qualify new products.  The Crown retains the right to negotiate with suppliers on any procurement.  Delivery Date: 01\/11\/2018  The Crown retains the right to negotiate with suppliers on any procurement.

The objective of this LOI is engaging and to solicit information regarding industrial capability, support solutions and costs, sufficient to allow for the conduct of a detailed analysis by DND, PSPC and ISEDC in order to fully define the sustainment solution for the Leo 2 FoV as well as the preferred procurement strategy to obtain long term support to the fleet.   There will be an Industry Engagement process for Leo 2 FoV.

This RFI #2 will not result in the award of any contract. Potential suppliers of any goods or services described in this RFI #2 should not reserve stock or facilities, nor allocate resources, as a result of any information contained in this RFI #2. Whether or not a potential supplier responds to this RFI #2 will not preclude that supplier from participating in any future procurements. Also, the procurement of any goods and services described in this RFI #2 will not necessarily follow. This RFI #2 is simply intended to provide information to Industry with respect to the subject matter described in this RFI #2.  REQUIREMENT DETAILS On behalf of its client the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS), Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) has a requirement for a third party contractor to provide administrative services only (ASO) claims processing and other related services for the Public Service Health Care Plan (PSHCP) as further described in this RFI#2.  RFI#2 PURPOSE The purpose of this RFI#2 is to: a) Inform industry of Canada\u0092s decision to adopt an Agile Engagement Approach Process (AEP) for the PSHCP ASO requirement.  b) share details on Canada\u0092s Agile Engagement Process (AEP); c) invite Industry to register for the AEP; and d) provide an updated procurement timeline.    POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT The PSHCP is an optional private health care plan sponsored by the Government of Canada for the benefit of its employees, pensioners, and their eligible dependents (see membership information below). The PSHCP is operated on a self-insured basis. The contemplated contractor will be responsible for the adjudication and payment of eligible claims in accordance with the PSHCP Plan Directive, Communiqu\u00e9s, and Bulletins and for providing services as specified in any resulting contract. \"The terms and conditions governing the benefits of the PSHCP are set out in the PSHCP Plan Directive and the Summary Of PSHCP Plan Changes Not Included In The Plan Directive. The current PSHCP Plan Directive (dated April 1, 2006) is available from the National Joint Council Web site at: http:\/\/www.njc-cnm.gc.ca\/directive\/d9\/v9\/en.   PSHCP GENERAL INFORMATION The PSHCP provides supplementary health care protection, including emergency benefits while traveling and emergency travel assistance services, as well as hospital benefits (I, II and III levels) for members and their eligible dependents who are covered under a provincial\/territorial health insurance plan.  The PSHCP provides reimbursement for a range of health-related goods and services that are not provided through private insurance plans, provincial or territorial insured health coverage or other publicly funded programs. As of December 31, 2017, the PSHCP had over 670,000 members (of which over 324,000 are retired members) and covers approximately 1.5 million Canadians with a total annual expenditures of approximately $1.22B. It is the largest employer-sponsored health care plan in Canada.  Membership in the PSHCP includes employees, the dependents of members of the Canadian Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Members of Parliament, Senators, the Governor General, Lieutenant Governors, Federal Judges, employees of a number of designated separate employers. Membership is available to pensioners receiving pensions under a number of federal pension statutes, including the Public Service Superannuation Act (PSSA), the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act (CFSA), the Defence Services Pension Continuation Act (DSPCA), the RCMP Superannuation Act (RCMPSA), the RCMP Pension Continuation Act (RCMPPCA), the Judges Act (JA), the Members of Parliament Retiring Allowances Act (MPRAA), the Governor General's Act (GGA), the Diplomatic Service (Special) Superannuation Act (DS(S)SA), the Lieutenant Governors Superannuation Act (LGSA) and the Special Retirement Arrangements Act (SRAA).  Membership is also offered to a number of Canadian Forces Veterans or their survivors who would not otherwise be eligible for PSHCP coverage.  The PSHCP offers services in both official languages.  Respondents are requested to provide RFI#2 responses in accordance with the instructions set out in RFI#2.  CONTEMPLATED INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT APPROACH In addition to the information and instructions provided in the LOI and RFI #1, Canada is incorporating for the PSHCP ASO requirement, the Agile Engagement Process (AEP).  The aim of the AEP is to more effectively provide Industry with time to review and provide feedback on draft documents.  In lieu of the traditional process, whereby Canada would wait to amass documents prior to sharing them with Industry via Buy&Sell, the AEP will facilitate the releasing of various draft PSHCP ASO solicitation documents on an iterative basis.  That is, various draft documents will be shared with Industry as and when they become available.  Registered participants will be e-mailed the documents directly.  To participate in the AEP, interested suppliers must respond by registering for the AEP.  This requires them to submit a signed and completed copy of the AEP Registration Form to the Contracting Authority, via e-mail.    SECURITY REQUIREMENT There are no security requirements associated with this RFI#2.

This solicitation is a Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) to renew the PASS SA procurement instruments which have been put in place to satisfy Canada's various requirements for audit and related professional services across Canada, excluding any locations in areas subject to any of the Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements.  It allows new and existing Suppliers to submit an arrangement to qualify for those Streams for which they wish to have an SA.  This procurement vehicle includes the eight following existing Streams of professional services:  Stream 1: Internal Audit; Stream 2: Internal Audit Quality Assessments; Stream 3: Information Technology and Systems Audit; Stream 4: Forensic Audit; Stream 5: External Audit; Stream 6: Financial and Accounting Services; Stream 7: Internal Control Training; and Stream 8: Recipient\/Contribution Agreement Audit  SAs resulting from this RFSA will not be used for staffing or for Temporary Help Services (THS) requirements.  The resulting SAs will remain valid until such time as Canada chooses to re-compete the SA, no longer deems the SAs necessary, or proceeds with a different procurement vehicle.  Unlike the PASS Re-competition solicitation (i.e. RFSA E60ZQ-180001\/C), this Refresh solicitation DOES NOT require all suppliers to submit an arrangement in order to be awarded or maintain a PASS SA.  This Refresh solicitation provides the opportunity to New Suppliers to qualify for a PASS SA; it also provides Existing Suppliers the opportunity to qualify for more Streams, etc., throughout the validity period of the PASS SA.  ***PLEASE REFER TO THE SOLICITATION DASHBOARD OF THE CPSS ePORTAL FOR THE CURRENT CLOSING DATE OF THE APPLICABLE REFRESH PERIOD***   SECURITY REQUIREMENT:  There is a security requirement associated with the requirement of the SA. For additional information, see Part 4 - Evaluation Procedures and Basis of Selection, Part 6A - Supply Arrangement.  SET-ASIDE PROGRAM FOR ABORIGINAL BUSINESS:  Part of this procurement may be designated by one or more Identified Users as set-aside under the federal government's Procurement Strategy for Aboriginal Business (PSAB).   In order to be considered as an Aboriginal Business under the PSAB, the Supplier must complete the Aboriginal Business certification contained in the Data Collection Component of the CPSS.  OFFICIAL LANGUAGES:  The services to be provided will be delivered in one or both of the two official languages of Canada according to the requirements of the Identified User issuing a contract against the SA.   CENTRALIZED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES SYSTEM (CPSS)  All suppliers that want to submit an arrangement will have to establish an account in the Supplier Module of the PWGSC Centralized Professional Services System (CPSS) e-Portal.  Instructions on accessing the Supplier Module e-Portal application are specified in the RFSA document published on GETS.   Suppliers will be required to submit a portion of their arrangement through the CPSS e-Portal Supplier Module.  Should suppliers encounter technical difficulties with the Data Collection Component (for example, not able to access, save, or enter data as noted), please review Attachment B of the RFSA (Guide to Centralized Professional Services System (CPSS) Data Collection Component) or send an email to the CPSS inbox at SSPC.CPSS@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca.

Suppliers may submit an arrangement for a specific configuration. Suppliers must however submit an arrangement for all items within the configuration for which an arrangement is submitted.  The Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) is to establish supply arrangements for the delivery of the requirement detailed in the RFSA to the Identified Users across Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs).  Any requirement for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, or Labrador will have to be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the resulting supply arrangements.  A SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA.  A SA is not a contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing a SA alone. The intent of a SA is to establish a framework to permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those bid solicitations.  All arrangements submitted under this Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) will be evaluated by Canada. An arrangement must comply with the requirements of the RFSA and meet all mandatory technical evaluation criteria to be declared responsive. All responsive arrangements will be recommended for issuance of a supply arrangement. Only suppliers who have been pre-qualified and have been awarded a SA will be allowed to submit bids for individual Request for Proposals (RFPs).  The period of the RFSA will be from the date of issuance to April 1, 2024.  Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity for pre-qualification during the RFSA validity period. A continuous Notice will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service(GETS) to allow new Suppliers to become pre-qualified. Existing pre-qualified Suppliers, who have been issued a SA, will not be required to submit a new arrangement. The existing pre-qualified Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity during the RFSA validity period to qualify new products.

This RFI will be continually amended to advise industry, on an on-going basis, of industry engagement activities and resulting feedback.   To facilitate the above process, it is Canada\u0092s intention to keep the RFI open until such time as a final Request for Proposal is released, however responses to phase II of the RFI process are requested by the date below:  RFI Requested Response Date: (revised) July 10th, 2019;  Purpose: This RFI is being issued with the key objectives of:  a.establishing a continuous single point of official project communications with potential suppliers; b.soliciting detailed feedback from potential suppliers on operational and technical requirements, cost and schedule; c.soliciting advice on industry capabilities to develop the Industrial Technological Benefits (ITB) Value Proposition with questions about industrial capacity for performing work related to the future contracts in Canada, strengthening Canadian supply chains, and making long-term investments in the Canadian IT sector; d.advising potential suppliers of the security requirements of the potential RFP(s) and resulting contract(s), and providing direction and assistance to unscreened suppliers in obtaining security clearances; e.answering questions from potential suppliers via an unclassified industry day and classified one-on-one meetings, ensuring all interested participants receive the same information; f.informing industry of the proposed procurement approach; and g.setting the conditions for successful follow-on project activities.    Requirement Description: The Department of National Defence (DND)\/Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) has a requirement to implement a secure, integrated Secret-level Information Technology (IT) infrastructure that will converge and reduce the number of DND\/CAF Secret networks, provide enhanced connectivity and information sharing capabilities within the DND\/CAF and with our mission partners, and readily evolve to meet future challenges. This IT infrastructure will enable commanders across the CAF to exercise Command and Control (C2), including at deployed headquarters, using the latest available technologies to provide optimal support capabilities.   The DND\/CAF will deliver this new capability through the Information Technology Infrastructure in Support of Command and Control (ITI in Sp of C2) Project, which will, among other things, strive to leverage industry capabilities and efficiencies to deliver services to the maximum extent possible.   The ITI in Sp of C2 Project is currently in the Options Analysis Phase, with a preferred implementation option expected to be identified and selected by Fall 2019; this will be followed by a Definition Phase and then an Implementation Phase. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) is planned for Fall 2025, and Full Operational Capability (FOC) for Winter 2028. Note that DND and Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) are looking to expedite these timelines to the best of their abilities.

BACKGROUND  Under the Government of Canada\u0092s Federal Contaminated Sites Action Plan, a number of legacy contaminated site properties (no longer maintained by their original occupants) exist at various remote locations in the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.  Such sites are the result of former mining, oil and gas, and military operations extending over a century when the environmental impacts of such activities were not adequately understood.  These site properties require a number of remediation or care and maintenance projects generally involving the minor demolition of structures, the remediation of soils and the construction of containment facilities.  REQUIREMENT  This RFSA aims to establish multiple supply arrangements for construction services among the supplier community.  The supply arrangements will be used exclusively for the northern contaminated sites projects that are located in remote and semi-remote locations (refer to the definitions in Part 6 (B), Section 1).  Limited tendering among supply arrangement holders will streamline the bid solicitation process for the remediation projects described above.    The intent of the SAs is to solicit proposals from qualified suppliers that are local (in proximity) to the location of a remediation project (refer to maps in Annex B) with preference to Aboriginal suppliers.  In addition to achieving socio-economic objectives, this will save on travel costs associated with completing the work in addition to supporting the local economy.  Firstly, the RFSA will establish separate lists of qualified suppliers for the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.  Secondly, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut will be further divided into administrative zones that allow PWGSC to establish sub-lists of qualified suppliers within each zone, while the Yukon Territory will serve as one whole administrative zone (with preference given to suppliers based within the community in closest proximity to the work site).  To qualify for a supply arrangement, suppliers must be licensed and permitted to provide construction services within the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories or Nunavut.  Suppliers will be asked to identify if they have a base of operations in one or more of the administrative zones within each Territory.  Having a base of operations in a given Territory and within an administrative zone will increase the likelihood that a supplier is invited to bid on a project.  Please note that a supplier is not required to have a base of operations within any administrative zone to qualify for a supply arrangement in a given Territory.  Should a supplier operate numerous bases of operations, the supplier may qualify for a supply arrangement in each of the corresponding administrative zones or Territories.  VALUE OF PROJECTS  Since pricing is specific to any particular remediation project, it will not be evaluated under this RFSA.  Pricing will be evaluated on a per project basis within the Request for Proposals (RFPs) that will be distributed among the suppliers who qualify for a supply arrangement.  Bid solicitations among supply arrangement holders will have two tiers with separate instructions, as defined in Part 6 (B), Section 2 - Bid Solicitation of this RFSA:  1.1 For requirements estimated below $100,000.00 (applicable taxes included), the requirement is subject to the Government Contracts Regulations (GCRs).  1.2 For requirements estimated at $100,000.00 to $2,000,000.00 (applicable taxes included), the requirement is subject to the provisions of the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA).  SOURCING  The proposed requirement is subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreement(s) (CLCAs).  One or more of the CLCAs listed in Annex \"E\" may apply to the bid solicitations distributed to any supply arrangement holders, dependant on delivery location(s).  It is not mandatory for suppliers to identify CLCA socio-economic benefits provisions to qualify for a SA, but SA holders may be requested to identify socio-economic benefits provisions under a bid solicitation process for services required within a CLCA. Refer to Annex \"F\" - Aboriginal Opportunities Considerations Plan or Inuit Benefits Plan for an example of the socio-economic criteria that may be included in a solicitation.  PWGSC intends to post this RFSA on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) at https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/tenders, where potential suppliers interested in submitting an arrangement will be required to download the documents.  There is no maximum number of supply arrangements that may be awarded as a result of this RFSA.  The supply arrangements have no defined end-date and will remain valid until such time as PWGSC no longer considers them to be advantageous to use them.  Supply arrangements may be used by PWGSC contracting authorities in the Pacific Region and the Western Region.  This PWGSC office provides procurement services to the public in English.   Delivery Date: Above-mentioned  The Crown retains the right to negotiate with suppliers on any procurement.  Documents may be submitted in either official language of Canada.","title":"Remediation Construction Services for Northern Contaminated Sites (EW479-192534\/B)","trade_agreement":"World Trade Organization-Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP), Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement, Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement (CKFTA), Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA), North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)","id":115},{"GSIN_code":["G009P"],"URL":"https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tender-notice\/PW-ZH-148-35622","buyer_contact":"St-Cyr, Audrey, audrey.st-cyr@tpsgc.gc.ca, (613) 858-9049 ( ), ( ) -, Terrasses de la Chaudi\u00e8re 5th Floor Terrasses de la Chaudi\u00e8re 5e \u00e9tage 10 Wellington Street, 10, rue Wellington, Gatineau Qu\u00e9bec K1A 0S5, Terrasses de la Chaudi\u00e8re 5th Floor Terrasses de la Chaudi\u00e8re 5e \u00e9tage 10 Wellington Street, 10, rue Wellington, Gatineau Qu\u00e9bec K1A 0S5","buyer_name":"Public Works and Government Services Canada","closing_date":"2019-11-28 14:00:00-04:00","location_of_work":"Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, National Capital Region, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Yukon","procurement_rules":"All interested suppliers may submit a bid","province_territory_of_work":["AB","BC","MB","ON","QC","NB","NL","NT","NS","NU","ON","PE","QC","SK","YK"],"published_date":"2019-04-26","selection_criteria":"Best Overall Proposal","tender_description":"Trade Agreement: NONE Tendering Procedures: All interested suppliers may submit a bid Competitive Procurement Strategy: Best Overall  Proposal Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement: No Nature of Requirements:   Office Ergonomic Assessment Services NMSO REFRESH E60ZH-190000\/C  St-Cyr, Audrey Telephone No. - (613) 858-9049  Audrey.St-Cyr@pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca  This Request for Standing Offer (RFSO) is to solicit offers for a Standing Offer (SO) for the provision of Office Ergonomic Assessment Services to all federal government departments and crown corporations.

Suppliers may submit an arrangement for a specific configuration. Suppliers must however ensure that all features and optional items within the Configuration(s) for which an arrangement is submitted are available when specified in the Solicitation.  The Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) is to establish supply arrangements for the delivery of the requirement detailed in the RFSA to the Identified Users across Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs).  Any requirement for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, or Labrador will have to be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the resulting supply arrangements.  A SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA.  A SA is not a contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing a SA alone. The intent of a SA is to establish a framework to permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those bid solicitations.  All arrangements submitted under this Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) will be evaluated by Canada. An arrangement must comply with the requirements of the RFSA and meet all mandatory technical evaluation criteria to be declared responsive. All responsive arrangements will be recommended for issuance of a supply arrangement. Only suppliers who have been pre-qualified and have been awarded a SA will be allowed to submit bids for individual Request for Proposals (RFPs).  The period of the RFSA will be from the date of issuance to April 1, 2024.  Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity for pre-qualification during the RFSA validity period. A continuous Notice will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service(GETS) to allow new Suppliers to become pre-qualified. Existing pre-qualified Suppliers, who have been issued a SA, will not be required to submit a new arrangement. The existing pre-qualified Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity during the RFSA validity period to qualify new products.

This new method of supply is a key procurement enabler for the GC\u0092s Cloud First direction and is part of an envisioned GC Cloud Services Procurement Vehicle framework that will consist of various methods of supply to satisfy both classified and unclassified cloud requirements.   The objectives of this SaaS RFSA are to:  a) simplify the procurement process to acquire SaaS Solutions and support GC procurement modernization and contract simplification initiatives;  b) increase competition and access to the latest SaaS solutions on the market for the GC; and  c) increase transparency, openness and fairness in public sector procurement processes.   As highlighted in the GC Digital Operations Strategic Plan: 2018-2022 published by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, procurement enablers such as this SaaS RFSA will help position the GC and public sector partners to leverage the latest digital technologies to achieve better results for Canadians.   Background:  The GC Cloud Services Procurement Vehicle framework represents an innovative approach to procure cloud by leveraging various methods of supply to satisfy cloud requirements for the GC and public sector entities, which may include but are not limited to provincial, territorial, and municipal governments.  On September 7, 2018, Shared Services Canada (SSC) published an Invitation to Qualify (ITQ) as the first stream of the procurement process for the GC Cloud Services Procurement Vehicle (https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tender-notice\/PW-18-00841719). In parallel, PSPC issued an RFI on October 29, 2018 to seek feedback from the industry on proposed approach and requirements to procure SaaS Solutions. PSPC received 47 responses to the Request for Information, and conducted one-on-one sessions with interested suppliers to refine the approach and requirements of this RFSA, and better align with industry best practices on cloud procurement.   Organizing the GC to Effectively Deliver Cloud Procurements:  Within the GC, PSPC and SSC jointly support federal organizations in procuring IT goods and services. With respect to procuring cloud-based offerings, the procurement responsibilities of each organization extends to the various elements of cloud stack from the infrastructure to the software application layers. The division of procurement responsibilities reflects the procurement mandate of each respective organization in supporting GC clients.  In line with each organization\u0092s mandate, SSC\u0092s procurement role in cloud-based offerings mirrors their responsibilities in managing the GC infrastructure, networks, common workplace technology devices and cyber security. PWGSC\u0092s procurement role is primarily in software application and development space, supporting clients in their service delivery and back-office functions.   This RFSA will qualify Suppliers for issuance of Supply Arrangements with SaaS solution catalogues and will facilitate simplified solicitation and contracting processes for individual client requirements.   PSPC and SSC are working closely to ensure the alignment of best practices on cloud procurement, including the development of a cloud commodity group to address limitation of liability as well as common security requirements. These elements lay the foundation of cloud procurement activities in the GC.   Overview of the Submission Review Process:  To best meet the needs of the GC and manage the volume of Submissions in response to this RFSA, the process to review Submissions and to qualify Suppliers will be categorized as follows:   a) Stream 1: will include Submissions from Suppliers with SaaS Solutions and Services that comply with Canada\u0092s requirements for storing and processing Protected B information as detailed in Annex A, Qualification Requirements, Tier 2.   b) Stream 2: will include Submissions from Suppliers with SaaS Solutions and Services that comply with Canada\u0092s requirements for storing and processing information up to Protected A, as detailed in Annex A, Qualification Requirements, Tier 1.   c) Stream 3: will include Submissions from Value-Added Resellers of SaaS Solutions and Services.  Value-Added Resellers who intend to present a Submission to qualify as a Supplier must comply with Annex A, Qualification Requirements, Tier 2 or Tier 1 (as applicable) and must submit certifications from the SaaS Publisher, in accordance with the SaaS Publisher Authorization Form (Form 3), to certify that the Supplier has been authorized to supply the SaaS Solution Publisher\u0092s Solution(s).

Because definitive diagnosis of CJD requires post mortem pathological examination of the brain, the CJDSS requires specialized laboratory services to conduct cranial autopsies, in which brain tissue is retrieved from patients suspected to have CJD and submitted to pathological examination.","title":"Autopsy services for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (1000210808)","trade_agreement":"None","id":133},{"GSIN_code":["N8430A"],"URL":"https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tender-notice\/PW-PR-760-77166","buyer_contact":"Richard, Josette, josette.richard@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca, (613) 462-4128 ( ), (613) 943-7970, L'Esplanade Laurier, East Tower 7th Floor Tour est 7e \u00e9tage 140 O'Connor, rue O'Connor, Ottawa Ontario K1 A 0R5, L'Esplanade Laurier, East Tower 7th Floor Tour est 7e \u00e9tage 140 O'Connor, rue O'Connor, Ottawa Ontario K1 A 0R5","buyer_name":"Department of National Defence","closing_date":"2019-09-24 14:00:00-04:00","location_of_work":"Alberta, Quebec","procurement_rules":"The bidder must supply Canadian goods and\/or services","province_territory_of_work":["AB","QC"],"published_date":"2019-05-28","selection_criteria":"Lowest\/Lower Bid","tender_description":"Trade Agreement: Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) Tendering Procedures: The bidder must supply Canadian goods and\/or services Competitive Procurement Strategy: Lowest\/Lower Bid Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement: No Nature of Requirements:   General Purpose Combat Boots  W8486-184068\/B Contact: Josette Richard Telephone: 613) 462-4128 Email: josette.richard@pwgsc-tpsgc.gc.ca  The Request for Proposal W8486-184068\/B supersedes and cancels solicitation number W8486-184068\/A dated 2018-02-01 with a closing of 2018-04-26 at 14h00 (EST).

The responses provided will contribute to further define the Statement of Operational Requirements (SOR) in a manner that is understandable by industry and meaningful to DND operational contexts, and thus contribute to better describing the strategic fit and operational needs for DND to achieve the required capability.   As the project progresses towards a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), this RFI will provide a continuous single point of official communication with industry. The project will use this RFI process for multiple purposes such as but not limited to:  a) Collaborating with industry on the draft high level SOR provided herein, including price and availability information; b) Ensuring all interested participants receive the same information; c) Collaborating with industry in the form of Post Submission Review Meetings; d) Presenting draft RFP documents to industry and soliciting comments and feedback on the project requirements and procurement strategies.   This initial RFI (Release #1) is to request industry feedback on the draft high level SOR provided as Annex A, gain an understanding of available submarine Flank Array systems and to receive additional product information in response to Flank Array questions provided as Annex B.  Additional questions may be asked of industry through amending this RFI. Please see the following link to learn how to follow updates to this RFI: https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tenders\/follow-opportunities  It is Canada\u0092s intention to keep the RFI open until such time as a final Request for Proposal is released, however responses to Release #1 of the RFI process are requested by the date below.  RFI Requested Response Date:  August 6th, 2019.   Background Information:  The Victoria-class Modernization (VCM) Program will provide modernized and increased capability to maintain the Victoria-class Submarines\u0092 (VCS\u0092) operational relevance through the mid-2030s. The VCM Program will be a collection of discrete projects (referred to as capability elements) that will be managed both individually and within a larger VCM Program portfolio to generate the necessary capability for Canada\u0092s submarines as detailed in Strong, Secure, Engaged - Canada\u0092s Defence Policy. Overall, the modernization outcomes will make Canada and its allies stronger and safer by:   a. positioning the VCS to contribute meaningfully to Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Joint Operations ashore;  b. ensuring the survivability of the VCS against an evolving threat in an increasingly complex and changing battlespace; and c. improving the habitability and deployment conditions onboard the VCS in support of Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) submariners.  This RFI relates to the VCM Flank Array capability element.  The current Flank Array is comprised of two 16-hydrophone arrays, one on each of the port and starboard sides. Analog signals from each port and starboard array element are fed, via copper cabling, to port and starboard amplifier groups. The amplifier groups transmit the amplified signals to the VCS AN\/BQQ-10 Sonar System.  The VCM Program wants better detection and performance from the new Flank Array.  Nature of the RFI:  This is not a bid solicitation and this RFI will not result in the award of any contract.   Procurement of the goods and services described in this RFI will not necessarily follow this request. Any procurements of this system\/equipment\/services will be in accordance with standard government procurement policies, i.e., formal RFPs.

This requirement is subject to a two (2) phase competitive procurement process.  The first phase, phase I, E60HP-18ASUV\/D Request For Supply Arrangement (RFSA) is a qualification process to create a pre-qualified supplier list for phase II. As a result of this phase I RFSA, a pre-qualified supplier list will be created.   The second phase, phase II, E60HP-18ASUV\/E will be issued to the suppliers on the phase I pre-qualified suppliers list to Request For Supply Arrangement (RFSA) to procure armoured sport utility vehicles ASUV Toyota Landcruisers or equivalent in accordance with Purchase Description.  Subsequently, qualified suppliers meeting the mandatory criteria of the RFSA, will be eligible to become a Supply Arrangement holder for the supply of armoured sport utility vehicles (Toyota Landcruisers 200 series or equivalent)  These vehicles are for delivery across foreign destinations and Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs). Any requirement for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, or Labrador will have to be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the resulting supply arrangements.   An SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA.  An SA is not a contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing a supply arrangement alone. The intent of a supply arrangement is to establish a framework to permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those bid solicitations.  All arrangements submitted under this Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) will be evaluated by Canada.  Suppliers meeting the technical capabilities will be placed on the SA.  Only suppliers who have been pre-qualified and have been awarded an SA will be allowed to submit bids for individual RFPs.  The period of the SAs will be indefinite from the date of issue.  Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity for qualification during the SA validity period. A continuous Notice will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) to allow new Suppliers to become qualified. Existing qualified Suppliers, who have been issued a supply arrangement, will not be required to submit a new arrangement. The existing qualified Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity during the SA validity period to qualify new products.

Transport Canada (TC) requires a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) that is capable of operation Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS).  TC will operate the RPAS as a proof of concept in order to evaluate RPAS technology to support the National Aerial Surveillance Program (NASP) in conjunction with the existing fleet of manned surveillance aircraft to maintain persistent domain awareness in Canada\u0092s Arctic.   In March 2016, Canada sought Industry consultation on the development of a proposed competitive procurement for the RPAS, initiated by Letter of Interest (LOI) T8493-150035\/A. In August 2016, Canada posted a second LOI, T8493-150035\/B, giving an overview of the Industry Consultative Process that had taken place. While developing the draft RFP in 2017, the possibility to acquire a surplus High Altitude Long Endurance RPAS from the Federal Republic of Germany became available and Canada explored that option.  After much investigation, it was determined to continue with Industry Engagement on a potential competitive solicitation.  The objectives of this LOI are to: 1) Provide the Draft RFP document (Attachment 2 to LOI); 2) Obtain review and feedback from potential suppliers to the draft RFP, in particular response to the specific Questions for Feedback. (Attachment 1 to LOI); 3) Open 1-on-1 meetings with Canada\u0092s RPAS project team to potential bidders to discuss understanding of the RFP process and their capability of meeting the requirements of the draft RFP.  Participants in this draft RFP phase of the Consultative Process should be potential suppliers to the requirement.  Potential bidders for this requirement may request a one-on-one meeting with Canada.   Written feedback, request for clarification, and, if applicable, request for a one-on-one meeting must only be sent to the PWGSC Contracting Authority via email and are requested to be received by the Submission of Responses date indicated below, but are also welcome before that date.  Submission of Responses:  July 18, 2019  The closing date of the LOI is August 21, 2019 for the purpose of posting further communications, if necessary, before issuing the final RFP.  This LOI is neither a call for tender nor a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No agreement or contract will be entered into based on this LOI.  The issuance of this LOI is not to be considered in any way a commitment by the Government of Canada, nor as authority to potential respondents to undertake any work that could be charged to Canada.

NOTICE OF PROPOSED PROCUREMENT (NPP) For the Pensioners\u0092 Dental Services Plan (PDSP) and Public Service Dental Care Plan (PSDCP) Administrative Services Only (ASO) Requirement  CONTRACT DURATION The PDSP & PSDCP ASO contract period will be defined following further internal and industry consultations. It is anticipated that Canada will issue a single contract for a period of eight years, with options to extend by one additional option period of two years plus two additional option periods of one year each, for a total of 12 consecutive years.   SOLICITATION METHOD: Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP)  NUMBER OF CONTRACTS: N\/A  NATURE OF THIS NPP This is not a bid solicitation. This NPP will not result in the award of any contract. Potential suppliers of any goods or services described in this NPP should not reserve stock or facilities, nor allocate resources, as a result of any information contained in this NPP. Whether or not a potential supplier responds to this NPP will not preclude that supplier from participating in any future procurements. Also, the procurement of any goods and services described in this NPP will not necessarily follow. This NPP is simply intended to provide information to industry with respect to the subject matter described in this NPP.  NPP PURPOSE The purpose of this NPP is to: a) inform industry of Canada\u0092s decision to adopt an Agile Engagement Process (AEP) for the PDSP & PSDCP ASO requirement; b) provide high level information related to the PDSP and PSDCP; and c) invite industry to register for the AEP.  POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT It is anticipated that Canada will issue a single Request for Proposal \/ contract for the provision of ASO services in support of the two dental plans described below.   PENSIONERS\u0092 DENTAL SERVICES PLAN (PDSP) \u0095 The PDSP is a voluntary dental services plan, sponsored by the Government of Canada, for retired members of the federal public service and their eligible dependents (family members).  \u0095 The contemplated contractor will be responsible for the adjudication and payment of eligible claims in accordance with the PDSP rules, communiqu\u00e9s, and bulletins and for providing services as specified in any resulting contract. The terms and conditions governing the benefits of the PDSP are set out in the PDSP rules. The current PDSP rules (dated May 4, 2010) are available at: https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/treasury-board-secretariat\/services\/benefit-plans\/pensioner-dental-services-plan\/pensioners-dental-services-plan-rules.html.   PDSP GENERAL INFORMATION \u0095 The PDSP is intended to provide coverage to eligible pensioners for specific dental services and supplies that are not covered under a provincial or territorial health or dental care plan. The PDSP covers only reasonable and customary dental treatment necessary to prevent or correct a dental disease or defect if the treatment is consistent with generally accepted dental practices.   \u0095 The PDSP is a voluntary plan for retirees of the public service, retired members of the Canadian Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Members of Parliament, Senators, Judges, Lieutenant Governors, and to certain other pensioners from participating agencies and entities identified under Schedule 1 of the Plan-Rules and their eligible dependents.  \u0095 The PDSP is \"self-insured\". This means that all plan expenses are covered from the contributions of the participating parties: the Government of Canada and the PDSP members. The Government of Canada has the sole legal and financial liability for the PDSP. The cost of the plan is shared equally between the Government of Canada and members. \u0095 In 2018, the PDSP had over 290,000 members with total paid claims of with total paid claims of $188.4M. \u0095 The PDSP is similar to, but separate from, the current Public Service Dental Care Plan (PSDCP) for federal employees.  PUBLIC SERVICE DENTAL CARE PLAN (PSDCP) \u0095 The Public Service Dental Care Plan (PSDCP) is a compulsory, self-insured employer paid dental care plan and covers all eligible federal public service employees, employees of a number of separate employers and their eligible dependents.  \u0095 The contemplated contractor will be responsible for the adjudication and payment of eligible claims in accordance with the PSDCP rules, communiqu\u00e9s, and bulletins and for providing services as specified in any resulting contract. The terms and conditions governing the benefits of the PSDCP are set out in the PSDCP rules. The current PSDCP rules (updated December 2018) are available at: https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/treasury-board-secretariat\/topics\/benefit-plans\/plans\/dental-care-plan\/rules-dental-care-plan-public-service-canada.html.  PSDCP GENERAL INFORMATION \u0095 The PSDCP provides coverage to eligible employees and their family members for specific dental services and supplies which are not covered under a provincial or territorial health or dental care plan. The PSDCP only covers reasonable and customary dental treatments that are necessary to prevent or correct a dental disease or defects, provided such treatments are consistent with generally-accepted dental practices. \u0095 The plan consists of 5 components: o Plan 55555 - National Joint Council Component;   o Plan 55666 - Public Service Alliance of Canada;  o Plan 55777 - Canadian Forces Dependents; o Plan 55888 - Royal Canadian Mounted Police Dependents; and, o Plan 55999 - Canadian Forces Reserves.      \u0095 In 2018, the PSDCP had slightly over 385,000 members with total paid claims of $279.7M.  CONTEMPLATED INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT APPROACH Canada intends to utilize an Agile Engagement Process (AEP) for the PDSP & PSDCP ASO procurement requirement. The aim of the AEP is to more effectively provide industry with time to review and provide feedback on draft documents.  In lieu of the traditional process, whereby Canada would wait to amass documents prior to sharing them with industry via Buy&Sell, the AEP will facilitate the releasing of various draft PDSP & PSDCP ASO solicitation documents on an iterative basis.  That is, various draft documents will be shared with industry as and when they become available.  Registered participants will be e-mailed the documents directly.  To participate in the AEP, interested suppliers must respond by registering for the AEP.  This requires them to submit a signed and completed copy of the AEP Registration Form to the Contracting Authority, via e-mail.

The Inspection Report, received in August 2016, identified several regulatory compliance issues including the finding that the majority of the existing flammable and acid storage cabinets in laboratories across the two buildings were inadequate and did not have the required regulatory certifications such as Underwriter Laboratories \u0093UL\u0094 Listing or Factory Mutual \u0093FM\u0094 Approval.   Due to the health and safety risks associated with storing flammable materials in uncertified flammable cabinets, DRDC requires the supply and installation of replacement flammable cabinets, along with several general storage and acid cabinets in buildings B001 and B010.   This requirement also includes the removal of existing uncertified flammable cabinets, and moving them to a location specified by the Technical Authority.

NOTICE OF PROPOSED PROCUREMENT (NPP) For the Pensioners\u0092 Dental Services Plan (PDSP) and Public Service Dental Care Plan (PSDCP) Administrative Services Only (ASO) Requirement  CONTRACT DURATION The PDSP & PSDCP ASO contract period will be defined following further internal and industry consultations. It is anticipated that Canada will issue a single contract for a period of eight years, with options to extend by one additional option period of two years plus two additional option periods of one year each, for a total of 12 consecutive years.   SOLICITATION METHOD: Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP)  NUMBER OF CONTRACTS: N\/A  NATURE OF THIS NPP This is not a bid solicitation. This NPP will not result in the award of any contract. Potential suppliers of any goods or services described in this NPP should not reserve stock or facilities, nor allocate resources, as a result of any information contained in this NPP. Whether or not a potential supplier responds to this NPP will not preclude that supplier from participating in any future procurements. Also, the procurement of any goods and services described in this NPP will not necessarily follow. This NPP is simply intended to provide information to industry with respect to the subject matter described in this NPP.  NPP PURPOSE The purpose of this NPP is to: a) inform industry of Canada\u0092s decision to adopt an Agile Engagement Process (AEP) for the PDSP & PSDCP ASO requirement; b) provide high level information related to the PDSP and PSDCP; and c) invite industry to register for the AEP.  POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT It is anticipated that Canada will issue a single Request for Proposal \/ contract for the provision of ASO services in support of the two dental plans described below.   PENSIONERS\u0092 DENTAL SERVICES PLAN (PDSP) \u0095 The PDSP is a voluntary dental services plan, sponsored by the Government of Canada, for retired members of the federal public service and their eligible dependents (family members).  \u0095 The contemplated contractor will be responsible for the adjudication and payment of eligible claims in accordance with the PDSP rules, communiqu\u00e9s, and bulletins and for providing services as specified in any resulting contract. The terms and conditions governing the benefits of the PDSP are set out in the PDSP rules. The current PDSP rules (dated May 4, 2010) are available at: https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/treasury-board-secretariat\/services\/benefit-plans\/pensioner-dental-services-plan\/pensioners-dental-services-plan-rules.html.   PDSP GENERAL INFORMATION \u0095 The PDSP is intended to provide coverage to eligible pensioners for specific dental services and supplies that are not covered under a provincial or territorial health or dental care plan. The PDSP covers only reasonable and customary dental treatment necessary to prevent or correct a dental disease or defect if the treatment is consistent with generally accepted dental practices.   \u0095 The PDSP is a voluntary plan for retirees of the public service, retired members of the Canadian Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Members of Parliament, Senators, Judges, Lieutenant Governors, and to certain other pensioners from participating agencies and entities identified under Schedule 1 of the Plan-Rules and their eligible dependents.  \u0095 The PDSP is \"self-insured\". This means that all plan expenses are covered from the contributions of the participating parties: the Government of Canada and the PDSP members. The Government of Canada has the sole legal and financial liability for the PDSP. The cost of the plan is shared equally between the Government of Canada and members. \u0095 In 2018, the PDSP had over 290,000 members with total paid claims of with total paid claims of $188.4M. \u0095 The PDSP is similar to, but separate from, the current Public Service Dental Care Plan (PSDCP) for federal employees.  PUBLIC SERVICE DENTAL CARE PLAN (PSDCP) \u0095 The Public Service Dental Care Plan (PSDCP) is a compulsory, self-insured employer paid dental care plan and covers all eligible federal public service employees, employees of a number of separate employers and their eligible dependents.  \u0095 The contemplated contractor will be responsible for the adjudication and payment of eligible claims in accordance with the PSDCP rules, communiqu\u00e9s, and bulletins and for providing services as specified in any resulting contract. The terms and conditions governing the benefits of the PSDCP are set out in the PSDCP rules. The current PSDCP rules (updated December 2018) are available at: https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/treasury-board-secretariat\/topics\/benefit-plans\/plans\/dental-care-plan\/rules-dental-care-plan-public-service-canada.html.  PSDCP GENERAL INFORMATION \u0095 The PSDCP provides coverage to eligible employees and their family members for specific dental services and supplies which are not covered under a provincial or territorial health or dental care plan. The PSDCP only covers reasonable and customary dental treatments that are necessary to prevent or correct a dental disease or defects, provided such treatments are consistent with generally-accepted dental practices. \u0095 The plan consists of 5 components: o Plan 55555 - National Joint Council Component;   o Plan 55666 - Public Service Alliance of Canada;  o Plan 55777 - Canadian Forces Dependents; o Plan 55888 - Royal Canadian Mounted Police Dependents; and, o Plan 55999 - Canadian Forces Reserves.      \u0095 In 2018, the PSDCP had slightly over 385,000 members with total paid claims of $279.7M.  CONTEMPLATED INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT APPROACH Canada intends to utilize an Agile Engagement Process (AEP) for the PDSP & PSDCP ASO procurement requirement. The aim of the AEP is to more effectively provide industry with time to review and provide feedback on draft documents.  In lieu of the traditional process, whereby Canada would wait to amass documents prior to sharing them with industry via Buy&Sell, the AEP will facilitate the releasing of various draft PDSP & PSDCP ASO solicitation documents on an iterative basis.  That is, various draft documents will be shared with industry as and when they become available.  Registered participants will be e-mailed the documents directly.  To participate in the AEP, interested suppliers must respond by registering for the AEP.  This requires them to submit a signed and completed copy of the AEP Registration Form to the Contracting Authority, via e-mail.

As this project progresses towards a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), this RFI\/LOI will provide a continuous single point of official communication with industry.  Canada intends to use this RFI\/LOI process to:   a) Provide industry with information relating to VISSC II\u0092s framework and Canada\u0092s approach to the procurement process;    b) Collaborate with industry on the Performance Work Statement, the Performance Requirements Specification, the procurement strategy, the Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) and Value Proposition (VP) strategy, relational agreement, basis of payment and bid evaluation; c) Seek feedback as to how Canada can effectively leverage industry to improve upon current submarine sustainment contracting practices and; d) To ensure the process is carried out with fairness and transparency by providing all interested participants with the same information.  The intent of this RFI\/LOI release is to provide notice that Canada intends to hold an Industry Conference to provide industry with a(an): a) High level overview of the VCS sustainment enterprise and what portion will apply to the VISSC II; b) Procurement Timeline; c) Industry Engagement Plan; d) Overview of the application of VP and the ITB framework; e) Proposed Invitation to Qualify (ITQ) Evaluation Criteria and; f) The opportunity to seek clarification from Canada on the presented context.      The conference will take place on:  16th of July, 2019. @ 1300h to 1400h  The location:  455 Boulevard de la Carri\u00e8re Gatineau, QC  J8Y 6V7   Conference room 217 on the 2nd floor.

Please see the following link to learn how to follow updates to this RFI: https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tenders\/follow-opportunities  It is Canada\u0092s intention to keep the RFI open until such time as a final Request for Proposal is released, however responses to Release #1 of the RFI process are requested by the date below.  RFI\/LOI Requested Response Date:  July 12th 2019.   Background Information: The VCS supports the RCN mandate to ensure the safety and security of Canadians at home and abroad.  To meet this mandate, the RCN as a part of the Canadian Armed Forces, provides combat-capable, multipurpose naval forces to support national and international security and humanitarian operations.  The VCS were initially designed and constructed by the United Kingdom\u0092s Royal Navy, and entered into service as the Upholder-class.  Between 2000 2004 the submarines were transferred to the RCN.  The individual submarines entered service with the RCN on the following dates: 1) HMCS VICTORIA (VIC) (December 2000); HMCS CORNER BROOK (COR) (June 2003); HMCS WINDSOR (WSR) (October 2003); and HMCS CHICOUTIMI (CHI) (September 2004).    To assist in maintaining the VCS as safe and capable war fighting vessels in an efficient and cost effective manner, the Department of National Defence (DND) remains committed to engaging with industry in an effort to improve upon how VCS sustainment is carried out in Canada.    With the release of Strong, Secure and Engaged (SSE) in June 2017, the Government of Canada (GoC) stated the intention for the RCN to extend the VCS ELE to the mid-2030s. This is complimented by the Victoria Class Modernization (VCM) Program.  While, the original service life of the VCS was 25 years, on acceptance into RCN service, the service life was adjusted until the mid-2030\u0092s timeframe to account for their unique service life to date.  Nature of this RFI\/LOI:  This is not a bid solicitation and this RFI will not result in the award of any contract.   Procurement of the goods and services described in this RFI will not necessarily follow this request. Any procurements of this system\/equipment\/services will be in accordance with standard government procurement policies, i.e., formal RFPs.   Respondents and potential suppliers of any goods or services described in this RFI should not earmark stock or facilities, nor allocate resources, as a result of any information contained in this RFI.

Background and Context    The accumulation of frost, snow and ice on critical aircraft surfaces (e.g., wing, rotor, aileron, rudder, stabilisers) pose considerable risks. For example, ice will alter the airflow over the wing and tail, which reduces the lift force that keeps a plane in the air and can cause a stall \u2013 a temporary, or permanent, loss of control of the aircraft which can lead to fatality. Snow and ice also adds excessive weight to an aircraft that reduces flight performance and when unaccounted for, results in hazardous flight operations.   To remediate ice build-up on the ground, products and procedures have been developed to remove, and to a certain extent prevent, snow and ice accumulation on aircraft. Ground procedures consist of spaying a de-icing and\/or anti-icing fluid on the aircraft minutes before takeoff followed by a mandatory inspection to ensure that all frozen contaminants have been removed from the critical surfaces. Currently, the only approved and reliable method of verifying that snow and ice has been safely removed is for personnel to conduct a close visual inspection, ideally accompanied by a physical touch (i.e., \u201ctactile check\u201d) of aircraft surfaces.   De-icing\/anti-icing fluid is very costly, not all airports have the required capabilities, and the entire process is time consuming. It is also extremely difficult to determine with certainty that aircraft surfaces have been cleared of all frozen contaminants following the procedure. Problem areas can be missed when relying solely on the visual detection of residual contamination.    Desired Outcomes    The DND\/CAF is looking for innovative solutions to address one or more of the following;     Reducing the time needed for ground procedures for de-icing\/anti-icing aircraft surfaces;   Reducing the cost associated with using de-icing\/anti-icing products, where applicable;   Quickly and reliably certifying that critical aircraft surfaces are free of frozen contaminants;      Supplemental Information    Currently, only certain airports have de-icing\/anti-icing capabilities. Innovators should consider solutions that are not predicated on the need for other expensive airport capabilities.   --------------------------------------------------------    ENQUIRIES    All Challenge-related enquiries must be submitted in writing to:    TPSGC.PAIDEES-APIDEAS.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca    Enquiries must be submitted no later than 10 calendar days before the Challenge notice closing date.

Background and Context    While \u201cspace debris\u201d technically includes asteroids, comets and meteoroids, this challenge refers specifically to orbit debris, space junk, space waste, space trash, space litter or space garbage, as well as fragments from their disintegration and collisions. Space surveillance networks regularly track about 22,300 debris objects in earth orbits, totaling more than 8,400 tonnes, which includes 1,950 operational satellites. As of January 2019, the total number of debris objects that are estimated by statistical models to be in earth orbits are 34,000 (greater than 10 cm); 900,000 objects (1 cm to 10 cm); and 128 million objects (1 mm to 1 cm) 1 .   When in Earth orbits, space debris pose a risk of collision with space vehicles, humans, and even with other debris. The hazards posed by debris collisions include erosion to hulls, solar panels and optics; fragmentation leading to rapid increases in the total population of space debris; total loss of a vehicle and\/or an asset; and major injury and\/or loss of human life. Space debris will grow as the number of human-made objects in Earth orbits increase over time.   There are no operational debris removal capabilities in use, globally, and existing prototypes lack important capabilities and have proven ineffective. For instance, there is a need to capture and deorbit multiple pieces of debris per clean-up effort or the capability becomes extremely expensive; as well, capabilities are needed to track and capture space debris smaller than 10cm or larger than the capturing vehicle (e.g., rocket bodies).    Desired Outcomes    The DND\/CAF is looking for innovative space debris solutions for one or more of the following:     Reliable and robust solutions for tracking space debris below the 10cm diameter size;   Concepts, designs or prototypes for deorbiting multiple pieces of debris of any size.      Supplementary Information    Canada adheres to several global treaties on the safe, secure and sustainable use of space and as well as voluntary global norms for responsible behavior by space-faring countries 2 . Measures must not be injurious to national security, to the defense of Canada, to the safety of the Canadian Armed Forces or to Canada\u2019s conduct of international relations. Innovation funding will not be granted for any options that are inconsistent with Canada\u2019s international obligations.   Different orbital regimes (Low Earth Orbit, Medium Earth Orbit, Geosynchronous Orbit, and Highly Elliptical Orbits) are expected to influence the way in which debris is tracked and removed (deorbited), and the length of time to execute the removal task. Innovators are asked to account for their assumptions with respect to the orbital regime within their funding proposals.    1  \u201cSpace Debris by the Numbers,\u201d  Space Debris , European Space Agency, January 2019,  https:\/\/www.esa.int\/Our_Activities\/Operations\/Space_Safety_Security\/Space_Debris\/Space_debris_by_the_numbers .    2  The most important global treaties to ensure the safe, sustainable use of outer space include:     Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies:  http:\/\/www.unoosa.org\/oosa\/en\/ourwork\/spacelaw\/treaties\/introouterspacetreaty.html ;   Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space:  http:\/\/www.unoosa.org\/oosa\/en\/ourwork\/spacelaw\/treaties\/introrescueagreement.html ;   Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects:  http:\/\/www.unoosa.org\/oosa\/en\/ourwork\/spacelaw\/treaties\/introliability-convention.html ; and   Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space:  http:\/\/www.unoosa.org\/oosa\/en\/ourwork\/spacelaw\/treaties\/introregistration-convention.html .     --------------------------------------------------------    ENQUIRIES    All Challenge-related enquiries must be submitted in writing to:    TPSGC.PAIDEES-APIDEAS.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca    Enquiries must be submitted no later than 10 calendar days before the Challenge notice closing date.

CHALLENGE DETAILS     Challenge Title    Now you see me, now you don\u2019t \u2013 reducing visual and infrared detection of soldiers and their vehicles    Challenge Statement    The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces (DND\/CAF) are looking for solutions for actively modifying the visual and infrared signatures of Army platforms in order to decrease detectability in changing environmental conditions and operational environments.    Background and Context    Being able to operate covertly offers a prime tactical advantage for Army. When platforms (i.e., soldiers and vehicles) have the ability to conceal their presence, they are more likely to detect threats before being detected themselves. Thus, masking the elements that make soldiers and vehicles stand out is critical to survivability. While signature management can be divided into several categories, the focus of this challenge is on the concealment and camouflage of platforms for visual and infrared (e.g., thermal) spectrums.   One approach in signature management is to print textiles (e.g. for Army uniforms and to coat or cover vehicles and other equipment) with a visual and near-infrared reflective pattern to mimic as much as possible the average background pattern of the environment(s) in which they are likely to be deployed. At present, combat uniform prints do not include any thermal infrared signature management schemes. Among the options that do exist, there are several notable challenges and limitations that need to be overcome. For instance, visual prints tend to under-perform in the upper spectrum of the near-Infrared spectral band (1350 nm and above); the addition of a low emissivity (low E) and\/or thermal convective layer materials that mimic the average temperature of background features must be put over the current combat uniform. The current difficulty with this approach is to combine the right mixture of low-E and\/or convective materials to blend with the environment. Vehicles and other equipment add-on camouflage may be bulky, fragile and manpower intensive. By its very nature, signature management needs to account for different mission contexts and constantly shifting environmental conditions. The most significant challenge with effective concealment is providing a single solution that is optimized for a wide range of environments. To date, it has not been possible to implement a single camouflage scheme that is equally effective in all conditions due to the highly varied and ever changing conditions (e.g. lighting conditions, composition of the background, ground and air temperature, etc.). An ideal solution is one that adapts to different mission contexts and environmental conditions.   There is a particular and added challenge when designing effective camouflage materials that provide thermal-infrared concealment. For soldiers, camouflage solutions need to achieve the right balance between visual and infrared concealment and an acceptable level of physiological comfort. For vehicles and other equipment, thermal-infrared concealment must provide infrared signature suppression without creating a detrimental effect on the performance of the equipment, power generation, heating, ventilation and cooling systems.   The pace of development of sensor technologies and proliferation of high performance, low cost sensors in the military and public domains are currently outpacing the performance of signature management systems. This presents a significant challenge for providing effective concealment and camouflage systems that will maintain the tactical advantage for our Forces.    Desired Outcomes    Research, design concepts and technologies are sought that address, but are not limited to, the following characteristics associated with concealment and camouflage:     Innovation in dyes and textiles will allow the extension of our camouflage specification and extend concealment into the shortwave infrared spectrum;   Innovation in dyes and textiles technology to permit spectral signature matching;   An integrated uniform design that provides thermal camouflage that is both durable (e.g., washable) and provides an acceptable level of the thermal comfort for the user;   Effective concealment of combat soldiers and vehicles against the next generation of threat sensors, including but not limited to multi-spectral and hyperspectral imaging;   An optimized signature management solution for a wide range of operating environments, threat sensors and changing conditions (e.g., time of day, weather, season);   Signature management technology that can actively adapt to environmental conditions in the visual spectrum and\/or the near-infrared and thermal spectrums;   Flexible and reliable devices and materials that permit spectrum changes with a prolonged operational life (e.g., months to years) that is effective in the visual and Near-infrared band;   Performance metrics for the characterisation of adaptive and multi-spectral concealment and camouflage benefits (e.g. thermal comfort, spectral signature matching, adaptation and effectiveness, reference environments).

Portable power for soldiers on the move    Challenge Statement    The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces (DND\/CAF) are looking for innovative power storage and power generation solutions for dismounted soldiers. The goal is to increase soldiers\u2019 autonomy, decrease the physical and cognitive burden of power storage technologies, and decrease the costs of fielding and exploiting wearable power technologies.    Background and Context    The dismounted soldier relies on many different power consuming systems (e.g., GPS, radio, Integrated Soldier System, night and thermal vision devices, etc.) that derive their energy from different types of batteries. Deployment of advanced technological systems provides a tactical advantage, but they also pose a cognitive load on soldiers who have to manage the power requirements of multiple power-consuming devices that are all critical to mission performance. Having to carry many different battery dependent technologies also poses a physical burden due to their bulk and weight. Batteries are one of the heaviest components of the dismounted soldier system, at present, contributing to decreased mobility (endurance, agility and speed).   Relying on battery dependent technologies is further complicated by the need to operate in isolated and austere environments while being subjected to highly variable and extreme climatic conditions. The need to replenish batteries can affect the length of a soldier\u2019s mission thereby limiting their independence, and it creates a logistical burden on the organization. Operating in extreme climactic conditions will also affect the capacity and degrade the performance of current power storage technologies.   Battery storage and transportation challenges are a major contributor to lifecycle costs for rechargeable batteries. Requirements to discharge cells for air shipment, compensate for self-discharge during storage, and analysis and recalibration of rechargeable batteries are some examples of depot and unit level battery fleet management and maintenance that contribute to the logistic burden and lifecycle costs associated with soldier wearable power solutions.   New solutions are needed for lightweight, high density, reliable, and cost-effective energy sources supported by robust power generation and harvesting technologies that are adapted to dismounted operations. The ability to easily share power and to rapidly recharge power sources are highly desirable. There is a further need to minimize degradation of performance in extreme climates (e.g., the Arctic). Given that the equipment is to be provided to a large number of soldiers, solutions must also have a low lifecycle cost.    Desired Outcomes    Research, design concepts and technologies are sought that address, but are not limited to, the following characteristics associated with power storage and power generation:     Research efforts to produce lighter, low volume, long-lasting, robust, and low-cost power sources that can be quickly exchanged, shared, and\/or recharged in austere environments;   Effective energy management solutions for soldier worn power sources and systems;   Alternative power generation and harvesting solutions that are cost-effective and adapted to dismounted operations (e.g., reliable, low volume, low weight, wide operating environment).      Additional Outcomes     Dramatic improvements in the operating temperature range of power sources;      A common power source to service the needs of multiple devices;   Improved interoperability of power storage and recharging solutions;   A scalable design that permits wearable mobile units to be upsized and integrated into facilities.      Supplementary Information    Solutions should not exacerbate issues with respect to \u201csafe-handling\u201d or logistical requirements associated with the infrastructure needed to recharge power sources.   --------------------------------------------------------    ENQUIRIES    All Challenge-related enquiries must be submitted in writing to:    TPSGC.PAIDEES-APIDEAS.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca    Enquiries must be submitted no later than 10 calendar days before the Challenge notice closing date.

Defend and protect satellites from natural and artificial threats    Challenge Statement    The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces (DND\/CAF) are looking for new and innovative capabilities that can be incorporated into the design and operation of Canada\u2019s space-based systems to defend and protect satellites from a range of natural and artificial threats.    Background and Context    The militaries of the Western democracies, including Canada, are increasingly dependent on capabilities that are delivered or enabled by space-based systems and their associated space and ground infrastructure (e.g., communications, surveillance, environmental monitoring, and navigation). The DND\/CAF is the only Canadian entity with the mandate of protecting and defending Canada's space capabilities. The Department works closely with allies and partners to ensure a coordinated approach to assuring continuous access to the space domain and space assets.   Satellites are vulnerable to natural and artificial threats (e.g., solar weather, collision with debris, etc.), as well as, increasingly, threats from adversaries who seek to deny, disrupt, or destroy Allied space systems (e.g., cyber-attacks, jamming, spoofing, laser dazzling, kinetic effects, etc.). Most satellite services are commercial in nature and, to date, defensive measures have not been a primary criteria in their design. Space is increasingly becoming a competitive, congested and contested environment and the DND\/CAF must defend and protect Canadian satellites or risk putting these capabilities, and its military operations, at risk.    Desired Outcomes    Satellites are susceptible to many different natural and artificial threats and adversarial attacks. Concepts, capability designs and prototypes are sought for defending against, but not limited to, the following:     Cyber data interception;   Cyber control command spoofing;   Electromagnetic threats (e.g., interference, jamming, spoofing, etc.);   Debris collision and co-orbital anti-satellite interceptions and collisions;   Physical manipulation by adversaries.      Additional Outcomes    Innovators are free to propose concepts, designs and prototypes to counter other threat vectors so long as they provide a sufficient and reasonable case as to their threat significance. Below are examples of other threat vectors for which additional solutions are being sought:     Adversary co-orbital anti-satellite collision;   Solar Weather, Radiation Belts, Ionization, and Spacecraft Charging;   Adversary ground-launched anti-satellite missiles;   Adversary co-orbital and ground-based laser dazzling, etc.      Supplementary Information    Canada adheres to several global treaties on the safe, secure and sustainable use of space, as well as voluntary global norms for responsible behavior by spare-faring countries 1 . Measures must not be injurious to national security, to the defence of Canada, to the safety of the Canadian Armed Forces or to Canada\u2019s conduct of international relations. Innovation funding will not be granted for any options that are inconsistent with Canada\u2019s international obligations.   Different orbital regimes (Low Earth Orbit, Medium Earth Orbit, Geosynchronous Orbit, and Highly Elliptical Orbits) will influence and change the threat vectors. Innovators are asked to account for their assumptions with respect to the orbital regime within their proposals.   Concepts and designs for defensive measures must account for the radiation environments generated by cosmic radiation, solar weather and interactions with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.    1  The most important global treaties to ensure the safe, sustainable use of outer space include:       Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies:   http:\/\/www.unoosa.org\/oosa\/en\/ourwork\/spacelaw\/treaties\/introouterspacetreaty.html ;     Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space:   http:\/\/www.unoosa.org\/oosa\/en\/ourwork\/spacelaw\/treaties\/introrescueagreement.html ;     Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects:   http:\/\/www.unoosa.org\/oosa\/en\/ourwork\/spacelaw\/treaties\/introliability-convention.html ; and     Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space:   http:\/\/www.unoosa.org\/oosa\/en\/ourwork\/spacelaw\/treaties\/introregistration-convention.html .     --------------------------------------------------------    ENQUIRIES    All Challenge-related enquiries must be submitted in writing to:    TPSGC.PAIDEES-APIDEAS.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca    Enquiries must be submitted no later than 10 calendar days before the Challenge notice closing date.

Industry Engagement activities will be used to give vendors an overview of the Gateway Robotics System Concept and support Canada in the development of key requirements, sourcing strategies and project timelines optimization.  BACKGROUND AND ECONOMIC STRATEGY  The mandate of the Canadian Space Agency is to promote the peaceful use and development of space, to advance the knowledge of space through science and to ensure that space science and technology provide social and economic benefits for Canadians. Exploration, Imagination, Innovation: A New Space Strategy for Canada was released on March 3, 2019 and reaffirmed Canada\u0092s commitment to participating in the Lunar Gateway. The strategy highlights Canada\u0092s strength in robotics and aims to leverage technologies developed by Canadian industry to position Canada\u0092s space sector as leaders in the growing global space economy, including the future on-orbit servicing market.    Canada has committed to contributing an Artificial Intelligence-enabled robotic system to the United States-led Lunar Gateway, a new space station to be developed in deep space to support human and robotic exploration of the Moon and eventually for missions to Mars. This new outpost will not be crewed continuously. As such, the smart robotic system, comprising a next-generation space robotic system and ground system collectively known as the Canadarm3, will be used to undertake operations on the Gateway without the presence of astronauts. The Gateway will be developed, serviced, and utilized in collaboration with international and commercial partners; the proposed smart robotic system will perform critical operations on the Gateway, to include logistics, maintenance, and operations of the deep-space outpost, as well as the deployment of science and technology experiments.   Canada\u0092s Space Strategy Exploration, Imagination, Innovation: A new Space Strategy for Canada can be found at http:\/\/www.asc-csa.gc.ca\/pdf\/eng\/publications\/space-strategy-for-canada.pdf  REQUIREMENT  Though the complete and\/or detailed design and manufacturing requirements for the project have yet to be determined, Canada\u0092s initial concept for the Canadarm3 robotic system is proposed to include the following elements:  1. The eXploration Large Arm and its Tools (XLA): Allows the system to perform inspection and maintenance operations, deploy payloads, capture and berth visiting vehicles, support Extra Vehicular Activities (EVAs), reconfigure the Gateway and assemble Lunar Landers.   2. The eXploration Dexterous Arm (small arm or XDA): Enhances the capabilities of the large arm and performs its maintenance, possibly capable of supporting payload exchanges through a Gateway airlock.  3. Various Robotic Interface Fixtures, Platforms and Receptacles: Needed on the different Gateway modules, components and on the robotic system itself.  These will ensure the required mobility for the two arms to perform their work, enable payload manipulation and provide worksites for experiments.  4. Ground Segment and Robotic Integration: Ground infrastructure that will provide planning, monitoring, commanding, training and visualization functions in support of operating the Robotics system from Canada; Support in integrated planning of Gateway assembly, logistics and utilization; will enable and manage the configuration of external science platforms.  ENGAGEMENT OBJECTIVES  As Canada works to better understand the capabilities within industry and academia and how to best leverage this procurement to ensure strong economic benefits for Canadians, Canada is requesting feedback and recommendations on a variety of technology and procurement topics including, but not limited to, the following:   1. Technical Considerations  1.1 Where are the opportunities for parsing work into small components for opportunities throughout industry? 1.2 What innovations are on the threshold of application within your organization that could be applied to this project? What new innovations are being explored currently within your organization? 1.3 To your knowledge, what are the technology gaps for a project of this type? What opportunities are there to fill these gaps by leveraging technologies\/know-how\/experience developed by Canadian industry in other sectors to stimulate technology transfers and maximize Canadian content for this project?  1.4 What is Canada\u0092s current or potential industry capacity to meet the requirements of the various smaller, technical components?  2. Procurement Considerations  2.1 What procurement approaches best enable industry to meet Canada\u0092s objectives, including technical requirements, schedule, cost and economic benefits? 2.2 How do we ensure a fair and transparent process for future phases of Lunar Gateway? 2.3 Are there opportunities to leverage joint ventures or collaboration with academia and superclusters? 2.4 Are there opportunities for injection of innovation, directed subcontracts or other strategies? 2.5 Are there possibilities to integrate performance incentives into the procurement? 2.6 What elements\/areas would most benefit from such incentives?  What would be appropriate levels of incentives?  2.7 Intellectual Property (IP) 2.7.1 How should Canada manage IP developed as a result of this procurement?   2.7.2 Who should retain ownership of the IP developed as a result of this procurement? 2.7.3 How will IP decisions impact on future commercialization and government operations?  2.8 In-kind contributions 2.8.1 Canada is seeking to motivate industry to bring forward innovative proposals that also seek to have co-investment from industry through in-kind contributions.  What type of in-kind contributions could industry provide? 2.8.2 What would be a suitable percentage of co-investment?  3. Economic Benefit Considerations  3.1 How can Canada best leverage the Lunar Gateway project to ensure maximum economic benefits to the Canadian economy? What are the key considerations? 3.2 What opportunities are there to stimulate innovation, technology transfers (both spin-ins and spin-offs) and commercialization from Canadarm3? Are there specific areas of the Canadarm3 technology that have the strongest commercial follow-on opportunities? 3.3 Where are the key areas for collaborative research (industry, academia and government)? How can Canada leverage collaboration to maximize economic benefits? 3.4 What opportunities are there for ecosystem development (e.g. robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, Advanced Materials, in operational systems including ground systems, machine vision, etc.)?  3.5 How can Canada support the role of small & medium enterprises (SMEs) in the space industry and related technology industries through Canadarm3? 3.6 Are there potential supply chain development opportunities from your point of view?  4. Industry Engagement plan  4.1 What feedback would industry or other stakeholders like to provide on this plan?  Are there additional engagement activities requested or recommended?  FAIRNESS MONITOR  Vendors are advised that Canada has determined that the services of a Fairness Monitor are warranted in support of the engagement and procurement process stages. The Fairness Monitoring Program provides client departments, government suppliers, Parliament and Canadians with independent assurance that Public Services and Procurement Canada conducts its activities in a fair, open and transparent way.

The management of the forest resources on this property is the responsibility of Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) through an Order-in-Council P.C. O.I.C 1961-807.   In the summer of 2017, approximately 4000 hectares of Douglas and Fir dominated stands in the north east corner of the property were damaged by wild fire. In addition, in the last decade, this property has also been adversely impacted by Mountain Pine Beetle.   Logging activities undertaken under various Timber Permit over the past few years has left some areas not satisfactory re-stocked. There is no plan to stop logging activities within the CTA in the near future. As a result, ISC has initiated a reforestation program on the property as part of ISC\u2019s due diligence to rehabilitate the forested land base.   ISC is looking to establish a contract to provide the services for one growing period. The growing period shall begin before January 2, 2020 to grow 1+0 seedlings and to carry out nursery tree seedling growing services in support of the reforestation plans on the CTA Lands.","title":"Nursery Tree Seedling Growing Services 2020-2021 (1000213473)","trade_agreement":"Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), World Trade Organization-Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO-AGP)","id":287},{"GSIN_code":["G103B"],"URL":"https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tender-notice\/PW-ZH-155-36707","buyer_contact":"Le, Lisa, lisa.le@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca, (613) 858-7912 ( ), ( ) -, Terrasses de la Chaudi\u00e8re 5th Floor Terrasses de la Chaudi\u00e8re 5e \u00e9tage 10 Wellington Street, 10, rue Wellington, Gatineau Qu\u00e9bec K1A 0S5, Terrasses de la Chaudi\u00e8re 5th Floor Terrasses de la Chaudi\u00e8re 5e \u00e9tage 10 Wellington Street, 10, rue Wellington, Gatineau Qu\u00e9bec K1A 0S5","buyer_name":"Correctional Service of Canada","closing_date":"2019-09-27 14:00:00-04:00","location_of_work":"Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, National Capital Region, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Yukon","procurement_rules":"All interested suppliers may submit a bid","province_territory_of_work":["AB","BC","MB","ON","QC","NB","NL","NT","NS","NU","ON","PE","QC","SK","YK"],"published_date":"2019-08-02","selection_criteria":"Subsequent\/Follow-on Contracts","tender_description":"Trade Agreement: NONE Tendering Procedures: All interested suppliers may submit a bid Competitive Procurement Strategy: Subsequent\/Follow-on Contracts Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement: No Nature of Requirements:   Work Placement Management Services (WPMS) 21120-177597\/A   Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), on behalf of Correctional Service Canada (CSC), has a requirement for Work Placement Management Services (WPMS), on an as and when requested basis, to provide ongoing placement and administrative management of Offenders under federal community supervision and on work release who are working for CORCAN or a contractor performing work for CORCAN in various locations across Canada.

Number of Contracts: It is expected that at least one (1)  Standing Offer Agreement  (SOA) per province or territory will be established as a result of this RFSO. Offerors need to qualify in the province(s) or territory(ies) where they want to offer their services   The work is currently being performed by a contractor.    DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:     Background:     The Superintendent of Bankruptcy supervises the administration of estates and matters to which the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA) applies. The BIA provides mechanisms enabling insolvent persons to be financially rehabilitated, and ensures the equitable and orderly distribution of debtors\u2019 property among their creditors. Among the available options, insolvent persons may voluntarily assign their property. One or more of the creditors may also cause the insolvent person to become bankrupt by means of an application filed with the court. The BIA also enables insolvent persons to make a proposal to their creditors to alter the terms of their debt repayment. Bankruptcies and proposals are administered by private-sector professionals licensed as LITs by the Superintendent in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BIA. In the context of their administration, LITs realize the property of bankrupts or collect payments pursuant to proposals. Monies collected are deposited in a trust account managed by the LIT. The LIT has fiduciary duties with regard to the management of these funds and must keep adequate books and records relating to them.   The Superintendent of Bankruptcy issues licences authorizing LITs to carry out their duties and the BIA confers on the Superintendent the power to cancel, suspend, or place conditions or limitations on LIT licenses. The Superintendent of Bankruptcy may initiate Conservatory Measures in the circumstances set out in subsection 14.03(2) of the BIA and may, pursuant to subsection 14.03(1) of the BIA, direct a person to take possession of the property of the estate in order to protect them and to preserve the rights of the creditors or the debtor. Conservatory Measures may be taken, for example, when a LIT neglects to pay the established licensing fees, upon the death of a LIT, when a LIT becomes unable to perform his duties, if a LIT is found guilty of an indictable offence that would render the LIT unable to perform his duties, or if the LIT becomes insolvent or does not comply with the conditions and limitations to which the licence is subject. In addition, Conservatory Measures may be taken if the LIT is the subject of an investigation that identifies offences and problems in the administration of estates that necessitate action being taken to protect the estates. In such cases, the Superintendent of Bankruptcy may request or direct a person as LIT in order to protect the estates and complete their administration.    Project Requirement \/ Objective :   The Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (OSB) is seeking to establish Standing Offer Agreements (SOA) in order to have at its disposal a list of suppliers who can act as Licensed Insolvency Trustees (LIT) upon request from the Superintendent of Bankruptcy in the context of Conservatory Measures under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA). Suppliers must hold individual or corporate licences under the BIA. The services of the selected LITs will be required depending on the needs of the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (OSB).    SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:    There is no security requirement applicable to the Contract.    Inquiries:    All enquiries regarding this bid solicitation must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Authority named below as early as possible within the solicitation period to allow sufficient time to provide a response.

The CFIA is a federal regulatory agency with a mission to safeguard food, animals and plants, which enhances the health and well-being of Canada\u2019s people, environment and economy. As Canada\u2019s largest science-based regulator, the CFIA works with various partners to support and develop science that contributes to evidence-based decisions that better protect Canada's food, animal and plant resources.   In order to attain a better understanding of the food safety risks that Canadians may be exposed to, the CFIA developed a series of surveys to target and profile commodities in the non-federally registered sector. Foods, such as bakery products, grains, grain products, juices, snack foods, beverages, coffee and tea, meal replacements, spices and seasonings, are subjected to analysis for certain hazards (allergen, chemical residues, contaminants and toxins). The collective results obtained through these Surveys will enable CFIA to:     enhance capacity to identify risks, to determine their origin, and to reduce and mitigate these risks;   to provide inspectors with additional tools to their activities, verify compliance, and take enforcement actions;   to improve consumers' ability to be well-engaged, in order to make informed decisions they must play an active role in the safety of their food;   to help industry and stakeholders play an active role in the safety of food by improving the Agency's guidance to assist them in implementing effective control systems.     As these data are to be used in health risk assessments, the supplier(s) must meet stringent quality assurance criteria. While, CFIA is continuously maintaining and monitoring these criteria, given the nature of the ever evolving food science and food industry, changes and modification to the list may happen in the upcoming RFSO.   The Supplier will be required to perform commercial laboratory services for the delivery of targeted surveys of allergens, chemical additives and residue contaminants (hazards) in food. The services will be conducted across Canada and be delivered to the National Capital Region (NCR).   The Supplier must collect the sample as defined in the sample plan and provide testing for one or more hazards in accordance with analytical methods and standard operating procedures (SOP). These methods must be accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) in the Program Specialty Area for Agriculture and Food Products, or under the Canadian Association for Laboratory Accreditation (CALA).    References    SCC  https:\/\/www.scc.ca\/en\/search\/palcan    CALA  http:\/\/www.cala.ca    The Canadian Food Inspection Agency intends to issue multiple NISOs for each of 13 Surveys as identified in Annex A, Statement of Work.

Background and purpose of this RFI  The purpose of this RFI is to seek industry comments and input to refine the procurement strategy and the definition of requirements for project W7701-176500 for Defence Research and Development Canada - Valcartier Research Centre.  The objective of this project is to meet future R&D needs in the areas of command, control, communications, computer systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR).  PSPC, on behalf of DRDC, is considering a Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) to pre-qualify suppliers. Each supplier that meets the stated requirements will be awarded a Supply Arrangement (SA). The potential SAs will allow for subsequent requests for proposals in R&D in the field of C4ISR. These SAs will have a term of five years, and the cumulative value of the resulting contracts could reach $20,000,000.  More specifically, we are seeking feedback on:  - The potential level of interest in providing services to address the requirements of the attached Statement of Work (Annex A); - The ability of companies to submit bids that meet the mandatory criteria described in attachment 1; - Information and suggestions on ways to improve this process or make it more efficient.  2.

Note to interested suppliers  There is no future contract issuance or purchase commitment from Canada. The issuance of this RFI does not oblige Canada to issue an RFSA, and does not bind Canada legally or otherwise, to enter into any agreement or to accept or reject any suggestions. As a result of this RFI, there will be no short listing of firms for the purposes of undertaking future work. Similarly, participation in this RFI is not a condition or prerequisite for participation in any RFP.  There will be no compensation for the information provided. Any and all expenses incurred by the suppliers in pursuing this opportunity, including the provision of information, are at the supplier\u0092s sole expense.  Suppliers are advised that any information submitted to Canada in response to this RFI may, or may not, be used by Canada in the development of a potential subsequent RFSA.

The maximum funding available for any Phase 1 Contract resulting from this Challenge is $100,000.00 CAD (plus tax) including shipping, travel and living expenses, as applicable, for up to 6 months.   The maximum funding available for any Phase 2 Contract resulting from this Challenge is $500,000.00 CAD (plus tax) including shipping, travel and living expenses, as applicable, for up to 12 months. Only eligible businesses that have completed Phase 1 could be considered for Phase 2.   This disclosure is made in good faith and does not commit Canada to contract for the total approximate funding.    TRAVEL:  \u00a0For Phase 1 it is anticipated that two meetings will require the successful bidder(s) to travel to the location identified below:    Kick-off meeting    Ottawa, ON    Final Review Meeting    Ottawa, ON    Problem Summary Statement     The CBSA is seeking a solution that will allow video and audio recordings to be automatically processed to ensure that people and objects other than the requestor of the audio or video files are not identifiable.    Problem Statement     The CBSA puts a lot of effort into processing video recordings collected at ports of entry, in order to comply with Access to Information requests. For example, it is common for a person to ask for all video footage at a certain location that contains their image. In order to comply, the Agency has to review the available video from the location, and identify and extract all scenes containing the individual. In addition, before the video footage can be released, it needs to be redacted so that other individuals and objects in the scenes cannot be identified, in order to protect the privacy of others. Given that the audio and\/or video processing is in support of an access to information request, the solution does not need to be at a forensic (i.e., court-ready) level.    Desired outcomes and Considerations      Essential (Mandatory) Outcomes    Proposed solutions must:     allow the processing of digital audio and video recordings, by redacting all instances of all personal identifiable content (for example, faces, name tags, license plate numbers) or retaining only particular information as described by the requestor   replace the zone of interest with black\/white pixels in order to ensure the redacting cannot be undone after the video is released   replace the zone of interest with silenced audio   be able to blur the overall scene in order to remove any background private information while maintaining the basic context of the scene.   minimise manual intervention after identifying initially a particular individual\/object in a video feed   manage a single redacting case from multiple media ingestion through all reviews and final media exports.\u00a0   be able to process and store information at a protected B level.  Reference Link:     Level of Security:  https:\/\/www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca\/esc-src\/protection-safeguarding\/niveaux-levels-eng.html        Safeguarding information:  https:\/\/www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca\/esc-src\/msi-ism\/chap5-eng.html     Additional Outcomes    Proposed solutions should:    successfully process between to 60 to 90 per cent of the video content without human intervention.     Background and Context     The current process is largely manual. Video footage is reviewed by employees to identify scenes containing certain individuals and to redact the scenes as needed. Today the redaction process is very manual and involves interacting with more then 50% of the video content most of the time. The process is facilitated by the use of specialized software, but is still very labour intensive. Based upon the available information, it currently takes between four to six hours of work for an Access to Information and Privacy Analyst for the editing and the rendering of one hour of video. The number of requests is increasing rapidly, partly due to increasing use of closed-circuit television systems. For example, from 2017-18 to 2018-19, the number of videos processed by the CBSA more than doubled, while the corresponding effort increased by more than a factor of five to approximately 1,800 person-days. Clients have a legislated right to request access to government information (Access to Information Act) and their own personal information (Privacy Act). Government\u2019s Institutions must respond to a request within the legislated timeframe, which is 30 calendar days for both Acts. The legislated timeframe for responding to Access to Information or Privacy requests is 30 calendar days. The Acts permits an institution to extend the time limit to respond to a request beyond the 30 calendar days only under certain circumstances. In 2018\u20132019, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) received 7,673 requests under the Access to Information Act, and reviewed 1,157,130 pages. The CBSA also received 13,447 requests under the Privacy Act, and reviewed 678,337 pages. Despite record high volumes of requests received, the CBSA responded to 94.3% of access requests and 97.9% of privacy requests within their statutory timelines. The product would help the CBSA to maintain such remarkable results over the coming years. The solution would be useful across a wide range of government organizations, both within Canada and internationally, as many of them collect video footage and are subject to Access to Information legislation.    ENQUIRIES     All enquiries must be submitted in writing to  TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca  no later than ten calendar days before the Challenge Notice closing date. Enquiries received after that time may not be answered.

One-on-one meetings: Interested suppliers may request a one-on-one meeting by contacting the contracting authority at the coordinates below no later than September 6, 2019.   ***********    Update - August 22, 2019    This notice amendment\u00a0is raised\u00a0to add the Industry Day presentation in the attachments menu below.   ***********   This NPP is issued to inform potential suppliers regarding the proposed procurement of a grants management solution (GMS) on behalf of the Tri-Agencies, the federal granting agencies that support research, research training and innovation in Canadian postsecondary and research institutions.\u00a0This grants management initiative is referred to as the TGMS Initiative.   The Tri-Agencies consist of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and together, annually award in excess of $3 billion of research grant and award funding.    Requirement    The Tri-Agencies\u2019 existing grants management systems are limited in their capacity to adapt to the changing needs of the research community and the Agencies\u2019 evolving business needs mainly because they are composed of non-integrated systems with limited integration capabilities.   By procuring a seamless user-centric grants management solution, there is an opportunity to modernize grants management and meet the standards of excellence that the Canadian research community and Tri-Agency staff expect in terms of efficiency, interoperability, accessibility, and usability, to counter:     Aging systems that are complex, administratively burdensome and time-consuming to use, resulting in an unsatisfactory user experience and inefficient processes.   Out-of-date technology that cannot be upgraded and is increasingly challenging to maintain. This rigidity impedes responsiveness to a changing research landscape and limits the ability of the agencies to collaborate on innovative programs.   Inconsistent data architecture and too many unnecessary data fields that create inefficiencies and impede data sharing and data analysis. This silo approach to data makes it difficult to conduct analysis of funded research.     The TGMS Initiative (referred to as TGMS or Solution) requirement is for the provision of a contractor configured, operated and supported grants management solution. In addition, the TGMS must provide required internal and external stakeholder interfaces and provide interfaces with Tri-Agency financial and business systems to enable implementation of an initial wave of grants and awards programs. Transition from existing Tri-Agency GMS systems will take place incrementally over several years to accommodate required program and organization change and to ensure continuity of services in current programs.   Additional information about the TGMS Initiative requirement is provided in Annex A, C, D and E.    Proposed Procurement Strategy    The TGMS Initiative requirement is proposed to be addressed through an agile procurement process as being evolved by Canada. This process incorporates gates with extensive stakeholder and industry engagement including requirements for hands-on exposure to potential TGMS Solutions by Tri-Agency stakeholders during various stages in the procurement.   The initial gate in the proposed TGMS agile procurement process is:   Gate 1: Industry and stakeholder engagement     An \u201cindustry day\u201d at which Canada will elaborate and answer questions on the scope of potential TGMS requirements and the PSPC and TGMS agile procurement process \u2013 est. August 23, 2019. Additional details on the Industry Day are provided in Annex B.     One-on-one meetings at which Canada will seek input on the topics outlined Annex B with interested suppliers following Industry Day \u2013 est. September 4-16, 2019. Additional details on the One-on-one meetings are provided in Annex B.     How to participate     Industry Day: Participation is intended for suppliers as the primary audience. To attend in person or via WebEx, please fill out the online registration form at  https:\/\/tgms-sgsto.eventbrite.ca . Participants will receive a confirmation of their registration and details about the session after registering.   One-on-one meetings: Interested suppliers may request a one-on-one meeting by contacting the contracting authority at the coordinates below.       The Gate 1\u00a0of the TGMS agile procurement process will be open to all potential suppliers of grants management related software and service solutions.  Canada may modify the proposed procurement strategy following the   industry and stakeholder engagement process  .     Gate 1 Feedback    Canada may request additional information for clarification during the review of feedback received in response to Gate 1.   No payment will be made for costs incurred in the participation in or preparation and submission of feedback to Gate 1.    No Obligation     The issuance of this NPP does not create an obligation for Canada to issue a subsequent solicitation and does not bind Canada legally or otherwise, to enter into any agreement or to accept any suggestions from industry.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ):   (This section will be updated on a weekly basis, if required)     Question 1:  Why did the first quarterly refresh not open until August 8th, 2019? When will my bid be evaluated?    Answer 1:  As of result of the number of changes being implemented for Temporary Help Services (THS) in the National Capital Region (NCR), Canada had no choice but to delay the release of the first refresh period. However, the government is adhering to the minimum of 40 days publication period set in the trade agreements.   Moving forward, the refresh schedule as outlined in the RFSA will be:   Q1 - Submission before June 30 \u2013 Evaluation from July 1 to September 30   Q2 - Submission before Sept 30 \u2013 Evaluation from October 1 to December 31   Q3 - Submission before Jan 3 \u2013 Evaluation from January 4 to March 31   Q4 - Submission before March 31 \u2013 Evaluation from April 1 to June 30    Question 2:  Why is this solicitation number different than the original RFSA? How do I find the solicitation?    Answer 2:  Due to system requirements, Canada was not able to publish two documents with the same number on buyandsell.com or Centralized Professional Services System (CPSS). In CPSS this solicitation can be found in the section \u201cSolicitations in Progress\u201d with the solicitation number: EN578-172870\/C \u2013 period: 1 (EN578-172870\/D).   Note that the period # will change at the start of each refresh period.\u00a0    Question 3:  How do I gain new categories? I noticed the evaluation criteria, M3 has changed.    Answer 3:  The evaluation criteria, M3 which details the requirements to substantiate categories has changed from EN578-172870\/C. In particular, the process to Newly Substantiate categories has changed from 3 references to 1 reference and from being collected outside of the Centralized Professional Services System to being collected through CPSS. Refer to M3 in the RFSA for additional details.   Due to the CPSS system being used by other government methods of supply not all options in the Stream & Category drop-down list apply to THS. Disregard the options that aren\u2019t listed in the RFSA.   Please refer to the RFSA\u2019s Attachment A section for instructions on completing your bid in CPSS.    Question 4:  How can I tell if I will be awarded a Standing Offer (SO) or a Supply Arrangement (SA)?    Answer 4:  Temporary Help Services (THS) for the National Capital Region (NCR) has eliminated the SO and replaced it with only a SA; this Request for Supply Arrangement (RFSA) solicitation.\u00a0   After evaluating your bid, the THS Team will be notifying your company via the email address provided in CPSS with details on if your company will be awarded a SA. If your company isn\u2019t awarded a SA, details will be provided for why including if only a portion of your bid was rejected, i.e., newly substantiated categories that weren\u2019t awarded.\u00a0    Question 5:  I was a supplier under the old Standing Offer and Supply Arrangement (SOSA) who missed submitting a bid for Solicitation EN578-172870\/C, will I be able to grandfather my SOSA categories for EN578-172870\/D? How will I go about grandfathering my categories?    Answer 5:  For the first refresh only, closing on September 30th, 2019, suppliers who had a SOSA arrangement are not required to requalify for categories they held but must complete the Grandfather Certification form.   Streams and categories will not be pre-populated in the Centralized Professional Services (CPSS)-Temporary Help Services (THS) portal. The onus is on the individual suppliers to input this information based on the Grandfathered list(s) that were already provided.   Due to the CPSS system being used by other government methods of supply not all options in the Stream & Category drop-down list apply to THS. Disregard the options that aren\u2019t listed in the RFSA.   Please refer to the RFSA\u2019s Attachment A section for instructions on completing your bid in CPSS.    Question 6:  In the Evaluation Procedures, Mandatory Technical Criteria, M3 Submission Instructions column it states \u201cQualify for 3 or more categories but indicate if you are not interested in supplying any of the remaining categories within that stream.\u201d. I assume this means that suppliers have the choice of supplying only the categories for which an offer has been submitted without supplying the whole stream.\u00a0    Answer 6:  Yes, suppliers have the choice of supplying only the requested categories if they do not intend on supplying the whole stream.   However, if bidders have 3 categories in a stream, they can gain the rest of the categories in the stream without providing references.   Please refer to the RFSA\u2019s Attachment A section for instructions on completing your bid in CPSS.    Question 7:  How do we identify ourselves as a diverse supplier?    Answer 7:     1- In CPSS, suppliers must check the box under the \u201cDiverse Status\u201d section.   2- In the RFSA, suppliers must refer to Annex B, Validation for Diverse Suppliers   3- Suppliers will be asked by the THS Team to submit the completed Diverse Supplier Self-Attestation form (Attachment \u201cB\u201d of the RFSA) by email.    Question 8:  I am a new supplier to the Government of Canada (GoC), can I bid on this requirement?    Answer 8:  Yes, as long as the supplier meets the RFSA requirements.    Question 9:  What regions are covered under this THS Method of Supply (MoS)?    Answer 9:  This solicitation covers only the National Capital Region (NCR). For information on other regions refer to the Temporary Help Services website \u2013 Regional Contact Information found at  https:\/\/www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca\/app-acq\/sat-ths\/region-eng.html     Question 10:  I submitted a response to the last THS refresh, solicitation #:\u00a0EN578-172870\/C, which was due March 20, 2019, and was successful in getting awarded a Supply Arrangement (SA). Do I need to re-apply through this solicitation?    Answer 10:  No, if your company was awarded am SA under the new THS you are not required to re-apply to this solicitation. However, if your company would like to make adjustments to your bid such as modifying your categories then this is to be done through the refresh.    Question 11:  I don\u2019t currently have an SA and just submitted my bid in Centralized Professional Service System (CPSS). What else is required from me?    Answer 11:  After the solicitation closing period has closed, Canada will be evaluating your bid and following up via email for additional documents which are identified as DCC+ in the RFSA - Submission Grid \u2013 Section 3.3; Canada encourages all bidders to have these documents prepared in PDF format so that a timely response can be provided. Additionally, note that Canada reserves the right to request additional information beyond what is identified in the RFSA \u2013 Submission Grid.","title":"Temporary Help Services for the NCR (EN578-172870\/D)","trade_agreement":"Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA), Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)","id":338},{"GSIN_code":["D302A"],"URL":"https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tender-notice\/PW-19-00884605","buyer_contact":"Greg Gauthier, contracting@osfi-bsif.gc.ca","buyer_name":"Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions","closing_date":"2019-09-13 14:00:00-04:00","location_of_work":"Canada","procurement_rules":"Open","province_territory_of_work":["NL","PE","NS","NB","QC","ON","MB","SK","AB","BC","YK","NT","NU"],"published_date":"2019-08-08","selection_criteria":null,"tender_description":"The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions needs a collaborative, learner-focused solution, such as a Learning Experience Platform (LXP), where the organization and employees alike can capture and share learning content that supports knowledge and skill development. \u00a0OSFI needs also to continue managing and tracking learning offerings and investments (i.e. learning plans), with better data collection to inform the relevancy and effectiveness of the various learning opportunities provided   The main objective of this request for information is to notify industry stakeholders of OSFI\u2019s intentions with respect to the acquisition of Learning Experience Platform software and to gather information to support the procurement process.

Number of Contracts: 1   The work is currently not being performed by a contractor.    DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:     Background:     Radio frequency spectrum is a finite public resource. Both private users and wireless communications service providers require spectrum for a diverse range of uses. ISED, through the   Department of Industry Act  , the   Radiocommunication Act   and the   Radiocommunication Regulations  , with due regard to the objectives of the   Telecommunications Act   is responsible for spectrum management in Canada. The Spectrum Management Program operates under the guidance of the   Spectrum Policy Framework for Canada  , which provides a single policy objective and a set of guidelines to guide ISED\u2019s management of this resource.   Where the demand for spectrum is not expected to exceed the supply, ISED generally uses a first-come, first-served licensing process to award spectrum licences. In instances where the demand for spectrum is expected to exceed supply, a competitive licensing process, such as an auction, is generally used.   The   Framework for Spectrum Auctions in Canada   describes the general approaches that ISED will use to auction spectrum licences. As indicated in the   Spectrum Policy Framework for Canada  , the Department has adopted a policy objective to maximize the economic and social benefits that Canadians derive from the use of the radio frequency spectrum resource.   In early 2017, ISED ran a competitive tendering process and subsequently contracted Power Auctions LLC of Washington DC, to provide auction consulting and hosting services for the upcoming 3500 MHz spectrum auction.   In June 2019, ISED initiated a consultation on the licensing framework for the auction of spectrum in the 3500 MHz band for flexible use. The allocation of 3500 MHz band is expected to foster innovation, investment and the evolution of wireless networks by enabling the development and adoption of 5G technologies. The band is currently used for fixed wireless broadband access.   The consultation proposes the use of a clock auction format with intra-round bidding for the 3500 MHz auction. This is a two-stage auction format that provides a simultaneous multiple-round clock stage for generic blocks to determine the quantity of blocks won in each product, followed by an assignment stage to determine the specific frequency assignment of each licence. The auction format will be confirmed in the Licensing Framework Decision.    Objective:    ISED is seeking an independent contractor to verify the Power Auctions software. The Contractor will develop and execute a plan to verify the Power Auctions software, including both the clock and assignment stages ensuring that the software implements the final auction rules in accordance with the Framework. Additionally, the Contractor will develop its own winner and price determination software for the assignment stage of the auction. This winner and price determination software will then be used to test and validate the Power Auctions software as well as to verify the final results of the assignment stage of the auction. At any point in time, if a discrepancy is detected between the two systems, the Contractor will work with ISED to identify the cause of the discrepancy as well as recommend and aid in the implementation of a solution.    SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:    The Bidder must comply with the provisions of the Security Requirements Check List (SRCL) and security guide attached at Appendix C.   In addition, the Bidder must submit, as part of their bid, the completed and signed Attestation Form (Part I) provided in Attachment 1 to Part 6.   The Bidder must also review the Security Requirements in Section 2 of Part 7 - Resulting Contract Clauses, including Appendix C \u2013 Approved Verifications for the required Criminal Record Background Check, for security requirements related to this requirement which the winning Bidder must meet.

The goal of this engagement is to give the public the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes through two-way dialogue.   Public engagement is a democratic process that must be transparent, relevant, inclusive, accountable and adaptable. In order to have an effective and open two-way dialogue with an increasingly diverse Canadian public in ways that are culturally relevant and appropriate - including in the official language of their choice - the GC uses a variety of approaches. In all cases, the GC aims to consider the public\u0092s input in decision making and to report on it.  Requirement:  The GC seeks the services of firms with the capacity and expertise required to undertake one, several or all activities in three categories and their six sub-categories of services related to public engagement activities, including public consultations, on an as- and when-required basis.  The GC may also require similar services for other types of engagement informing decision making.  More details on the requirement are available in the Statement of Work.  Period of Standing Offer:  Initial period of two years with three one-year options to extend.  Procurement Process:  The procurement process and call-up procedures are detailed in the Request for Standing Offer (RFSO).

It is expected that INFC will have an ongoing need for this type of solution beyond that point following a future re-assessment.   Background:   INFC leads federal efforts to ensure that Canadians benefit from world-class, modern public infrastructure. We achieve this by making investments, building partnerships, developing policies, delivering programs, and fostering knowledge. The department is a key funding partner, working with provinces, territories, municipalities, the private sector and non-profit organizations, along with other federal departments and agencies to help build and revitalize the infrastructure Canadians need and use every day.   In order to meet and sustain these efforts, INFC needs to assign, deliver and track training, including mandatory Government of Canada training and custom INFC training so all duties required of INFC employees can be performed. This is in addition to courses offered by the Canada School of the Public Service (CSPS). Meeting each specific duty is not restricted to a specific organizational unit (e.g. programs group for a specific region) or functional group (e.g. administrative assistants) at INFC.   To help accomplish this, INFC needs to implement a department-wide Learning Management System (LMS) to provide a one-window learning portal for all INFC staff (currently 600 and this is expected to increase in the next few years). INFC is also required to maintain a comprehensive learning file and history for each of its staff and pass that on to any other government department or agency where INFC staff move to in their career. As part of good governance, INFC is also required to conduct reporting on HR programs, including training.   The LMS would, in part, host training that is developed by INFC staff using specific Authoring software (obtained separately from this Contract). It would also need to be able to import data (from csv files) of course attendance and completion of INFC staff offered by the CSPS as well as generate reports.

Background and Context    When Canadian Armed Forces are deployed today, it tends to be Brigade-sized tactical military formations comprising 3,200 to 5,500 personnel in order to allow for the type of mobility and flexibility that is needed to respond to new types of missions and emerging threats. Each brigade has a self-contained headquarters (HQ) and staff that are responsible for planning and conducting operations, as directed by the Government of Canada, anywhere in the world.   The collection, analysis, fusion and sharing of information is vitally important for exercising command and control, and new capabilities are needed to better support modern network-enabled applications. The military has relied on wired networking (i.e., fiber optics) for communications, which provides a high bandwidth as well as the required level of security, but there are number of drawbacks including the cost, time and resource requirements for set-up and take-down.   Wireless networking offers the promise of significant benefits over wired networking in relation to cost, flexibility and mobility. However, at present, there are unacceptable trade-offs related to performance and security that prevent its adoption within a deployed HQ. Wi-Fi uses radio frequency (RF) technology to broadcast signals that can be detected by adversaries and used to gain unauthorized access to the communication system or as a vector for a cyberattack. The electromagnetic emanations can also act as a beacon that reveals the location of the HQ to adversaries.    Desired Outcomes    The DND\/CAF is looking for innovative solutions for a mobile wireless network that includes, but is not limited, to the following capabilities:     A secure wireless network with sufficient speed, capacity and bandwidth to permit the simultaneous connection of up to 50 users within a 200 meter coverage radius;   A network capable of operating at peak performance and efficiency;   Effective wireless network security measures, including, but not limited to the following:   Ability to protect the wireless network from cyberattacks and jamming;   Means of detecting possible intrusions and breaches to the network;   Ability to mitigate risks associated with the need to connect to other networks;       A set of tools to help isolate and quickly resolve problems with the network;   Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) transmission capabilities for operating across paths that are partially or fully obstructed, including vehicles, buildings, trees, and hills;   An electromagnetic barrier for the containment of the wireless network in order to prevent the detection and identification of the HQ based on its electromagnetic emanations;   A compartmentalized and ruggedized system that is easily transportable by sea, land or air; one that is easily and quickly installed and dismantled; as well as easy to use and manage.  Supplementary Information        Security concerns prevent the installation of a tower over the surrounding landscape within a deployed camp for the mounting of electronic communications equipment and antennae.   --------------------------------------------------------    ENQUIRIES    All Challenge-related enquiries must be submitted in writing to:    TPSGC.PAIDEES-APIDEAS.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca    Enquiries must be submitted no later than 10 calendar days before the Challenge notice closing date.

Background and Context    Activity-Based Intelligence (ABI) is a methodological framework for analyzing data sources. It is used to discover correlations, resolve unknown-unknowns, develop knowledge, drive data collection and make inferences based on having access to large data sets and large sets of observations originating from different but complementary data sources. Given the volume of data available, analysts can spend excessive time searching for data. In order to keep a step ahead of one\u2019s adversaries, speed and accuracy are vitally important. New data driven automated tools, techniques and approaches are needed to supplement (not supplant) the work of Analysts by supporting their ability to filter data, automatically detect patterns, and test hypotheses.   There are several steps in the process. Before data can be aggregated, managed and exploited, it has to extract the geospatial and temporal information. All actions take place at a time and location in physical space. Algorithms are needed to extract spatiotemporal information from data sources when it is available and to rapidly and accurately infer missing information. The next step involves data fusion. Multiple and simultaneous sources of data are often needed to describe the activities of entities across time and space. Data must be integrated in order to establish context and support advanced spatiotemporal analysis. The goal is to build models of potential outcomes, anticipate what may happen and why in order to support decisions, such as when to forestall an anticipated event or action of an adversary.    Desired Outcomes    Develop and apply new and innovative tools, techniques and approaches to support real or nearly real-time ABI. Innovators must choose a problem that is deemed relevant to defence and security for which archival and real-time data sets can be accessed, aggregated, managed and exploited by the innovator.   The overall objective of the Challenge is to detect activities of interest, discover new activities of interest and to anticipate events or actions, by minimally aggregating geospatial and time information.   The desired outcomes of the challenge include, but are not limited, to the following:     Ability to derive timely, predictive insights from the data set with respect to the problem;   Ability to detect patterns and infer activities of interest;   Means of rapidly pulling existing geospatial and date\/time stamped data from all sources when it is available as part of the meta-data, and rapidly inferring data that is missing;   Ways of simplifying the task of filtering massive amounts of data from multiple sources;   Ability to combine and aggregate a minimum of three (3) different data sources and formats;   Ability to identify and incorporate at least three (3) additional variables of interest for analysis;      Supplementary Information    Innovators must identify a real-world problem of interest that is relevant to defence and security for which large datasets can be readily accessed. No further information will be provided to applicants by DND\/CAF.   .Innovators are asked to submit solution proposals involving data that will maximize their ability to demonstrate their capabilities.   The following are limited examples of problem areas that innovators might choose to focus on:     Sovereignty concerns such as illegal fishing, smuggling, migrant ships, Arctic incursions;   Traffic accident prediction;   Natural disasters;   Predictors of political instability and political violence, etc.     --------------------------------------------------------    ENQUIRIES    All Challenge-related enquiries must be submitted in writing to:    TPSGC.PAIDEES-APIDEAS.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca    Enquiries must be submitted no later than 10 calendar days before the Challenge notice closing date.

This disclosure is made in good faith and does not commit Canada to contract for the total approximate funding.   --------------------------------------------------------    CHALLENGE DETAILS     Challenge Statement    The Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces (DND\/CAF) are seeking ruggedized wind turbines for the Arctic to reduce the reliance on diesel fuel generated power.    Background and Context    The demand for electrical power and space heating in the Canadian Subarctic and High Arctic is fulfilled almost exclusively with diesel-fired generators. The DND\/CAF is seeking to reduce petroleum-generated electrical energy consumption in the North in order to minimize operational, logistical, but as importantly, to reduce the environmental burden. Wind turbines, , are already in limited use in the North, but there are major hurdles to overcome before they can be fully exploited as a source of alternative energy.   Canada's far North and Arctic region is characterized by seasonally frozen ground and deep snow, rugged terrain, permafrost, and extreme temperatures that can reach -60\u00ba C in the High Arctic. The High Arctic and Subarctic also experience frequent high winds (80-120 km\/hr). Wind turbine designs are needed that are ruggedized and able to withstand this harsh arctic climate and terrain. Very high ultraviolet (UV) radiation, extreme cold and wind severely impacts the durability of designs. Very strong arctic winds may destroy the turbines and composite materials (e.g., plastic, Kevlar) become fragile in the cold. Furthermore, ice-rimming of wind turbine blades also represents a significant problem that can affect turbine operations\/efficiency.   Climate change is causing additional challenges for the structural design of arctic wind turbine foundations. Permafrost that has persisted for thousands of years is thawing and refreezing each season, causing existing buildings\/foundations to sink, shift and crack. The design of a foundation must allow the turbine to remain level as well as account for the pressure to tip over due to the force of the wind interacting with the blades and rotor.   Typical wind turbines are absolutely massive in size, which significantly limits their potential use in remote and isolated northern locations given significant barriers related to transportation and installation. A typical unit that supplies 2-4 MW of energy have size dimensions that exceed 120 meters in height and have blades that are 80-90 meters long, which requires hundreds of tons of concrete for the base. The blades and shafts are typically made out of composite materials in order to limit their overall weight and reduce the logistical burden of lifting them during installation. A unit of that size is not as practical for most northern installations, and in any case, are designed to supply much more power than is necessary for the current challenge. A turbine that services one DND\/CAF location only needs to have a power output of 10 kW to 500 kW.   Wind turbines are needed that have smaller MW capacities and are logistically manageable. Many DND\/CAF locations exist in isolated locations or within small, arctic communities that have limited or no road access and must be reached by other means of transportation such as barges or heavy-lift aircraft. The roads that do exist tend to be built on ice in the winter months and have weight limits. Consequently, new designs must be modular to simplify transport by air, ship or ice road. Ideally, future designs would also make use of readily available parts or parts that are easy to manufacture in order to simplify the installation, maintenance and repair. Designs should also be easy to assemble by non-technicians using commonly available tools. New materials are needed that will similarly limit the burdens of installation, address durability concerns, and might further include radar absorbing materials (RAM) to mitigate interference with communications systems.    Desired Outcomes    Research, design concepts and technologies are sought that address the following:     Wind turbines that have electrical generation capacities of 10 kW to 500 kW.   Lightweight materials that can withstand the effects of very high UV radiation, extreme cold and extreme wind in the Subarctic and High Arctic;   Materials and\/or methods to mitigate ice-rimming of turbine blades;   Materials which incorporate radar absorbing properties to limit interference with communications;      Additional Outcomes      Approaches to wind turbine design and their foundations which account for climate change related impacts (i.e., melting permafrost);   Modular wind turbine designs to facilitate ease of transport by air, ship or ice road;   Designs that rely on readily available parts to simplify manufacturing and repairs; and\/or   Designs that are easy to re-assemble\/maintain by non-technicians using commonly available tools.     --------------------------------------------------------    ENQUIRIES    All Challenge-related enquiries must be submitted in writing to:    TPSGC.PAIDEES-APIDEAS.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca    Enquiries must be submitted no later than 10 calendar days before the Challenge notice closing date.

Background and Context    Any operation will have a series of mission-essential functions that need to be maintained in order for the mission to continue and be successfully completed. The first step is to identify and prioritize these functions; the critical cyber capabilities and assets upon which a mission depends. Tools are required to support, simplify and expedite the task of identifying cyber vulnerabilities and risks to a mission.   Secondly, there is a need to analyze, prioritize and mitigate the risks. Impact assessments help decision-makers to know which cyber systems need to be protected. Risk assessments incorporate vulnerability and threat information to support active cyber defence planning and remediation. Tools are needed that provide decision-makers with a risk assessment to help them prioritize mitigation actions   Finally, the third issue involves the static nature of most efforts to identify and mitigate cyber dependencies and vulnerabilities. Assessments do not reflect the highly dynamic context in which missions and operations occur. Risks need to be continually identified and any mitigations need to be assessed. It is an iterative process that must be undertaken as quickly as possible.   A related problem involves the need for tools and capabilities to support automated, vulnerability scanning. Many technologies currently exist in the Information Technology (IT) world continuously scan a traditional enterprise network for known vulnerabilities. That capability is nascent for Operational Technologies (OT) and Platform Technologies (PT).    Desired Outcomes    Innovative research, tools, design concepts and\/or technologies are sought that address, but are not limited to, one or more of the following areas associated with cyber security:     Mission-oriented cyber security training strategies, methods and tools for:   Military Commanders (to understand vulnerabilities and dependencies);   Technical experts (to understand the military operations).       Tools to support, simplify, expedite and\/or automate the identification and mitigation of cyber vulnerabilities and risks to a mission;   Dynamic risk assessment, prioritization and mitigation management in the face of changing threats that accounts for the known vulnerabilities of cyber systems, threats to those systems, and the impact to operational missions.   Automated vulnerability scanning for military OT\/PT platforms and systems.     --------------------------------------------------------    ENQUIRIES    All Challenge-related enquiries must be submitted in writing to:    TPSGC.PAIDEES-APIDEAS.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca    Enquiries must be submitted no later than 10 calendar days before the Challenge notice closing date.

Background and Context    Smart mobile devices are now ubiquitous. In the last 40 years, personal computers, wired and wireless networking, pagers, cellular phones, and the internet, have revolutionized the way people communicate, share information, collaborate, and conduct business. With current 4G and 5G technology and the latest smart devices, the real and online world have converged more than ever. While this convergence enables the exchange of real-time information anywhere, anytime, in various forms and fidelity, it also potentially exposes the individual\u2019s privacy and their personal information to others.   The focus of this Challenge is to permit users to continue to leverage the full power of smart mobile devices to conduct business in the office and on the move, while minimizing the risk to their privacy and to sensitive information. When using these untrusted networks, the challenge is to maintain the anonymity of the person and their device and be aware of the integrity of their network connection.    Desired Outcomes    Innovative concepts, designs, or technologies to mitigate risk to confidentiality and integrity when exchanging private and sensitive information using smart mobile devices (mainly smart phones) on untrusted networks (cellular, WiFi, or wired) are sought, including but not limited to:     Means to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information exchanged;   Means to increase anonymity of smart mobile devices on untrusted networks;   Means to increase anonymity of individuals (e.g., physical identity and location as well as identity, footprint, behavioral pattern, etc.) when using smart mobile devices; and\/or   Means to detect man-in-the-middle attacks and other threats to the integrity of the network connection on untrusted networks.     --------------------------------------------------------    ENQUIRIES    All Challenge-related enquiries must be submitted in writing to:    TPSGC.PAIDEES-APIDEAS.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca    Enquiries must be submitted no later than 10 calendar days before the Challenge notice closing date.

Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) intends to retain an individual consulting firm, or joint venture, to provide professional services to modernize laboratory facilities as part of a program of work related to the Laboratories Canada (LC). Science Facility laboratories in Mississauga, Sudbury, Guelph and Ottawa may form part of the overall Contract as determined by the priorities of PWGSC\u0092s LC program. The base Contract consists of the laboratory expansion and fit-up of a joint National Research Council (NRC) and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) facility in Mississauga, Ontario. PWGSC will add incremental Consultant Services to the Contract through Contract option(s) as its Science Partner clients determine their location-specific scope of laboratory modernization.  This is a single phase selection process. The nature of the requirement and the anticipated limited number of responses by the industry leads PWGSC to believe that this approach will not unduly force a large number of firms to expend an overall unreasonable amount of effort in response to PWGSC.  Proponents responding to this RFP are requested to submit a full and complete proposal. The proposal will cover not only the qualifications, experience and organization of the proposed Consultant Team, but also the detailed approach to the work, and the pricing and terms offered. A combination of the technical and price of services submissions will constitute the proposal. The Proponent must be authorized to provide architectural and multidisciplinary engineering services, licensed, or eligible to be licensed, certified or otherwise authorized to provide the necessary professional services to the full extent that may be required by provincial law in any province of Canada.  SECURITY REQUIREMENT  1. Before award of a contract, the following conditions must be met:  (a) the Proponent must hold a valid organization security clearance as indicated in Supplementary Conditions SC1;  (b) the Proponent's proposed individuals requiring access to classified or protected information, assets or sensitive work site(s) must meet the security requirement as indicated in Supplementary Conditions SC1;  (c) the Proponent must provide the name of all individuals who will require access to classified or protected information, assets or sensitive work sites.;  2. Proponents are reminded to obtain the required security clearance promptly. Any delay in the award of a contract to allow the successful Proponent to obtain the required clearance will be at the entire discretion of the Contracting Authority.  3. For additional information on security requirements, proponents should refer to the Contract Security Program of Public Works and Government Services Canada ((http:\/\/www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca\/esc-src\/introduction-eng.html) website.

Problem Statement     Micro-organisms and microbial mixtures have the capacity to perform novel and complex tasks in a diverse array of biotechnology applications, many of which support the goals of sustainability. The testing required under the regulations for assessment can be expensive. When multiple micro-organisms are used together in a mixture, the cost of testing becomes prohibitive to the small-medium enterprises that represent the majority of notifiers. Companies have requested the option to conduct testing on the microbial mixture, but it is unknown how interactions between micro-organisms in the mixture during testing could affect prediction of an adverse effect subsequent to environmental release. Lack of suitable test methodologies and novel approaches to determine the adverse effects of microbial mixtures also puts pressure on the program to provide timely guidance to notifiers to meet the regulatory requirements or to assess the notifications within regulated timelines, which prevents Canadian companies from bringing products to the market. The solution will equip HC with complete information needed to conduct the risk assessment of biotechnology-derived products containing microbial mixtures, and meet its operational and regulatory responsibility. It would enable HC to provide informed guidance to notifiers on cost-effective, reliable test methods required to fulfill the regulatory requirements prior to the manufacture or import of microbial mixtures into Canada.    Desired Outcomes and Considerations     Essential (Mandatory) Outcomes    The solution  must  be a cost-effective*, robust and reliable** method to:   (i) identify members of microbial mixtures;   (ii) characterize their stability and population dynamics; and   (iii) predict possible interactions among the micro-organisms in the mixture (e.g. using omic approaches such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.), that may mask or enhance adverse effects (e.g. pathogenicity, toxicity) in humans.     Cost-effective*- Current cost estimate is about $150K per micro-organism for accurate identification and characterization of micro-organisms in microbial mixtures, and conducting pathogenicity\/toxicity testing for one micro-organism with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP). The solution must aim to reduce these testing costs significantly and make it affordable for SMEs.   Robust and reliable**- The solution must provide a well-constructed method with demonstrated sensitivity (capable of identifying wide range of target micro-organisms in the mixture with threshold of detection limits defined), specificity (capable of distinguishing different micro-organisms in the mixture at least to species level) and reproducibility (reliable for any microbial mixtures containing different micro-organisms.      Additional Outcomes    N\/A    Background and Context     There is an increasing demand to enrich natural microbial consortia and formulated microbial mixtures. These complex microbial products often display an enhanced adaptability to complex nutrient substrates and tolerance to environmental stressors. The capacity of microbial mixtures to perform novel and complex tasks has diverse biotechnology applications, many of which support the goals of sustainability (e.g. contaminated site remediation, production of hydrogen fuels, biofuels, biogas or bioplastics, or replacement of harmful substances in products such as cleaners, complete waste recycling for space missions). In order to comply with the  New Substances Notifications Regulations (Organisms)  [NSNR (Organisms)], notifiers intending to manufacture or import micro-organisms contained in such products are required to submit data from tests supporting the taxonomic identity and characterization of micro-organisms in these mixtures as well as to determine their potential to cause adverse effects (pathogenicity, toxicity, etc.) to humans and the environment. The testing required under the regulations for assessment can be expensive for companies. When multiple micro-organisms are employed together in a mixture, the cost of testing quickly becomes prohibitive to the small-medium enterprises (SMEs) that represent the majority of our notifiers. In addition, there currently exist no tests or models to predict the fate or complex interactions between multiple micro-organisms in various environments, including conditions found in human body. Lack of suitable test methodologies and novel approaches to determine the adverse effects of complex microbial mixtures also place an increasing demand on the Department\u2019s capability to provide timely guidance to notifiers to meet the NSNR (Organisms) requirements or to assess the notifications within regulated timelines. The goal of this research is\u00a0to develop a cost-effective, robust and reliable automated method to identify members of microbial mixtures and consortium, characterize their stability and population dynamics, and predict possible interactions between individual micro-organisms of the mixture (e.g. using OMIC approaches such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.) that may mask or enhance adverse effects (pathogenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, hypersensitivity, etc.) in humans. The outcomes from the challenge will empower the program with cutting-edge science-based methods and tools to assess complex microbial mixtures and consortia, as well, provide informed guidance to biotechnology industry stakeholders on cost-effective, reliable test methods and help them to meet the regulatory requirements of the NSNR (Organisms). This challenge will particularly benefit the small-medium enterprises, as they will have the option of using alternative methods to test microbial mixtures that are less expensive than testing individual microbial constituents present in the mixtures.    ENQUIRIES     All enquiries must be submitted in writing to TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca no later than ten calendar days before the Challenge Notice closing date.

If no supplier submits, a Statement of Capabilities that meets the requirements set out in the ACAN, on or before the closing date stated in this ACAN, the Contracting Officer may then proceed with the award to the pre-identified supplier.    DEFINITION OF REQUIREMENT: \u00a0   This project entitled \u201cGenetic analyses of feed intake, feed efficiency, female fertility, and cow lifetime productivity in beef cattle raised under two environments\u201d is being funded by the Beef Cattle Research Council (BCRC) from 2018 to 2023 (FDE.06.17).   The proposed feed analysis work is part of an approved Beef Cattle Research Council. project focusing on developing advanced genomic tools through utilizing functional information of DNA variants to predict feed efficiency traits for Canadian beef cattle. A key component of this research is to have the DNA of cattle genotyped to associate DNA polymorphisms(SNPs) with economically important traits.   This project involves genotyping several hundred animals ever year from ranches throughout Alberta. AAFC is responsible for genotyping a portion of the animals and in collaboration with the University of Alberta which will genotype the remainder. Since 400 Industry cattle will be genotyped on the GGP-50K (a proprietary panel owned by Neogen) by the University of Alberta we must also genotype other animals on GGP panels so there is significant overlap. If we cannot get the animals genotyped on the same or similar panels then we cannot perform genomic prediction, the project will fail to meet its objectives. Neogen Canada is the only genotyping service provider in Canada that can genotype bovine DNA on the GGP panels, therefore we require this genotyping services to be done through Neogen Canada.    CRITERIA FOR ASSESSMENT OF THE STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES:    Any interested supplier must demonstrate by way of a statement of capabilities that it meets the following requirements:     Knowledge and experience in the DNA extraction from bovine blood, hair, tissue or semen samples.   Knowledge and experience in DNA quantification .   Knowledge and experience in SNP genotyping of bovine DNA using Neogen GGP SNP genotyping panels (low density or high density panels).      JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PRE-IDENTIFIED SUPPLIER:    The pre-identified supplier (below) is the only known supplier that meets the requirement set out above. Should Canada receive a statement of capabilities from a supplier that contains sufficient information to indicate that it meets the requirements set forth in this ACAN, a competitive process will be triggered with a technical and financial evaluation methodology of the bids proposed by the potential bidders.    EXCEPTION TO THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS REGULATIONS:    Section 6 (d) has been invoked for this procurement as only one supplier (person\/firm) is capable of performing the work.   Where, for works of art, or for reasons connected with the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights, or proprietary information\u00a0or where there is an absence of competition for technical reasons, the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable alternative or substitute exists.

Before awarding a standing offer, however, the government would like to provide other suppliers with the opportunity to demonstrate that they are capable of satisfying the requirements set out in this Notice, by submitting a statement of capabilities during the ACAN posting period.   If other potential suppliers submit a statement of capabilities during this ACAN posting period that meets the requirements set out in the ACAN, the government will proceed to a full tendering process on either GETS or through traditional means, in order to award the standing offer.   If no other supplier submits, on or before the closing date, a statement of capabilities meeting the requirements set out in the ACAN, a standing offer will be awarded to the pre-selected supplier.    BACKGROUND:    The purpose of this project is to support Dr. Stephen Raverty Consulting Ltd. for the Response to Dead Marine Animals in the Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Pacific Region.   It aims to ensure the safe examination and\/or necropsy of whales or small cetaceans, or other marine animals, when deemed safe to do so, thus providing scientific information on marine species, with an emphasis on currently listed under the  Species at Risk Act   (SARA ), and informing mitigation measures for the protection of marine species. This project is also an opportunity to collect data safely, that may contribute to scientific studies to improve our understanding of these species.    REQUIREMENTS - TASKS AND ACTIVITIES    The contractor is required to deliver the project in accordance with the Statement of Work ONLY in situations and conditions considered safe for such delivery. Under no circumstances should the contractor attempt to respond to a marine animal if environmental\/weather conditions, or the logistical circumstances are not reasonable and safe given the circumstances of the disentanglement or release activity proposed. The contractor shall monitor the environmental\/weather conditions for changes that render the response operation no longer safe. The contractor must adhere to SARA permit issued and any other protocols and authorizations that may be provided by the DFO.","title":"Response to Dead Marine Animals in DFO Pacific Region for Safe Examination and\/or Necropsy (F5211-190245)","trade_agreement":"Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT), Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)","id":588},{"GSIN_code":["R010A"],"URL":"https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tender-notice\/PW-19-00887131","buyer_contact":"Perron, Steve, steve.perron@csc-scc.gc.ca, 613-992-6509, 340 Laurier Ave Ottawa ON K1A 0P9 CA, 340 Laurier Ave Ottawa ON K1A 0P9 CA","buyer_name":"Correctional Service of Canada","closing_date":"2019-09-12 14:00:00-04:00","location_of_work":"National Capital Region","procurement_rules":"Open","province_territory_of_work":["ON","QC"],"published_date":"2019-08-28","selection_criteria":null,"tender_description":"NOTICE OF PROPOSED PROCUREMENT (NPP)     PROFESSIONAL AUDIT SUPPORT SERVICES (PASS)      SUPPLY ARRANGEMENT     Solicitation No.:  21120-19-3076047    Contracting Authority:  Steve Perron    Telephone No.:  613-992-6509       E-mail Address:  steve.perron@csc-scc.gc.ca    This RFP is only for pre-qualified Suppliers   for Stream 1: Internal Audit Services; Stream 3: Information Technology and Systems Audits and   Stream 4: Forensic Audits against Professional Audit Support Services (PASS) Supply Arrangement (E60ZG-060004)     DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:    The objective of this contract is to provide CSC\u2019s Internal Audit Sector with Professional Audit resources to complete various engagements on a task authorisation basis.   \uf09fWork Stream 1: Internal Audit;   \uf09fWork Stream 3: Information Technology and Systems Audit;   \uf09fWork Stream 4: Forensic Audit;    DURATION OF CONTRACT    The period of the Contract is for one (1) year with the irrevocable option to extend the term of the Contract by up to four (4) additional one (1) year period(s) under the same conditions.

Summary  Background  The Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) is responsible for protecting Canada and defending its sovereignty, defending North America and contributing to international peace and security. To carry out their responsibilities, CAF members must be equipped with operational clothing and footwear (OCF) that provides the necessary protection and operational mobility to conduct daily operations anywhere in the world. OCFC2 builds on the existing Consolidated Clothing Contract (C3) model operating in DND today for dress and occupational \/ environment uniform commodities, offering assurance of a tried and proven business model which has evolved through the last 20 years. For all items stipulated under contract, a prime vendor would be responsible for their acquisition, as well as inventory and distribution management and other services. This managed clothing solution (MCS) provides for the opportunity to develop a direct delivery system between the contractor and the individual military member. In addition, OCFC2 will allow for lower contract management and administrative overhead, lower inventory, improved acquisition cycles, improved response times for corrective actions and product improvement while allowing the apparel, textile and footwear industries to remain competitive, innovative and responsive.  Brief Description  The MCS will provide end-to-end management of the DND supply chain for Operational Clothing and Footwear (OCF), from acquisition and\/or manufacturing to inventory management to distribution. It will include professional and design services as well as configuration management.  The successful bidder will supply DND with a complete supply chain management approach that encompasses program management services, professional services, manufacturing, warehousing and inventory management, order processing and management, and distribution and delivery. The MCS will also provide an online Order Management System (OMS) for use by Authorized Users who will order items for Direct Delivery to the address of their choice. National and international deliveries may be required by the successful Bidder; destinations will only be specified at time of order.   Period of the Contract  The contract period will be for an initial period of 6 years from the date of the contract, with the option to extend the term of the contract by up to fourteen (14) additional one (1) year period under the same terms and conditions.

TRAVEL:  \u00a0No travel is anticipated    Kick-off meeting    Teleconference\/videoconference    Progress Review Meeting(s)    Teleconference\/videoconference    Final Review Meeting    Teleconference\/videoconference    Problem Summary Statement     The Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada (TBS) and Shared Services Canada (SSC) are seeking a standardized method to issue and rapidly verify portable digital credentials across many different contexts, thereby reducing human judgement error, increasing efficiency and ensuring digital credential veracity using cryptography.    Problem Statement     This challenge is seeking a portable secure digital credentials (self-sovereign identity) solution held by individuals that can be independently, cryptographically and rapidly verified using emerging distributed ledger standards and an approach that may give rise to a global digital verification platform. For many contexts, ranging from applying for a job to transiting checkpoints for aviation security, paper documents remain the predominant way to prove key attributes about an individual, such as their name, date of birth, academic\/professional qualifications, or security clearance. While these attributes might be presented in digital form, there are no widely adopted or standardized methods to issue and rapidly verify digital credentials across many different contexts. There exists no current capability to digitally verify without dependencies on centralized or low-latency network platforms (or both).    Note:  The operational solution will be required to store all personal information within Canada    Desired outcomes and Considerations      Essential (Mandatory) Outcomes      Create User-centric Verifiable Digital Credentials able to operate on a national or global interoperable verification platform   Protect the privacy and identity of the user at all times   Incorporate the following emerging and\/or mature specifications for interoperability that have been funded, tested and\/or championed by the United States of America Department of Homeland Security:       Verifiable Credentials: Blockcerts and\/or Hyperledger Project Indy   Decentralized Identifiers (Standards Development Organizations: World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) or Decentralized Identity Foundation),   Verifiable Credentials (Standards Development Organization - W3C); and   JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data \/ JSON-LD (Standards Development Organization - W3C).     4. Adhere to applicable policy instruments, guidelines and frameworks, including but not limited to:     Requirements specified in the Treasury Board Directive on Identity Management; and   Conformance Criteria specified in the Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework.      Additional Outcomes    Proposed solutions should:     Give issuers and recipients ownership of their official records that can be cryptographically signed and presented anywhere to verify credential provenance and ownership.   Give issuers and recipients autonomy over how they use their records and verify digital credentials. For example, if issuers decide to switch vendors later on, they retain full access and use of their digital certificates.   Give relying trusted third parties the ability to verify any record independently, in independent fashion, for free and independent of any software vendor or issuing institution. Relying parties can easily verify any digital credential through widely available technology such as a web browser or a mobile phone. Verification is based on open and interoperable approaches.   Provide leading-edge digital credential security to enable the global trust economy that are cryptographically signed thus enabling third parties to verify their provenance and ownership.   Demonstrate the components of self-sovereign identity:       decentralized and portable;   demonstrated control of attributes; and   independence from a centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.      Background and Context     This challenge intends to determine the feasibility and characteristics of developing a national or global interoperable verification platform that can be used to independently verify digital credentials issued by a dynamic set of trusted issuers, and used by a broad and diverse population of users. This can be tested in a context, such as aviation security where there are many actors and authorities operating across many organizational and geographical boundaries. Building on these standards, the goal is to prove that a decentralized, interoperable digital verification ecosystem can be built that can be used by many independent issuers, operators, and most importantly users, by means of open-source libraries and standards-based capabilities. In order for a new technology to gain adoption, it must be made accessible through easy-to-use and widely available software and ubiquitous infrastructure such as Blockchain, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLTs) and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). A government could potentially leverage these and develop a ubiquitous infrastructure with enhanced transparency and auditing of public service operations, greater visibility into multi-party business operations, and automation of paper-based processes to improve delivery of services to organizations and citizens. There exists a common need to issue entitlements, attestations and certifications for a variety of purposes including travel, training, education, affiliation, organizational identity and delegated authority and more. Current issuance processes are often paper based, non-interoperable and are susceptible to loss, destruction, forgery, and counterfeiting. While there is a diversity of contexts, there are many common needs across different departmental and agency contexts with a potential use of interoperable implementations of Blockchain, DLTs and SSI that also support the growth and availability of a competitive marketplace of diverse technology implementations for government and industry to draw upon to deliver cost effective and innovative solutions. For many contexts, ranging from applying for a job to transiting checkpoints for aviation security, paper documents remain the predominant way to prove key attributes about an individual, such as their name, date of birth, academic\/professional qualifications, or security clearance. While these attributes might be presented in digital form, there are no widely adopted or standardized methods to issue and rapidly verify digital credentials across many different contexts. There exists no current capability to digitally verify without dependencies on centralized or low-latency network platforms (or both). In addition, there is a potential need for self-sovereign identity, which is the concept that people and businesses can store their own identity data on their own devices, and provide it efficiently to those who need to validate it, without relying on a central repository of identity data.

TRAVEL:  \u00a0No travel is anticipated    Kick-off meeting    Teleconference\/videoconference    Progress Review Meeting(s)    Teleconference\/videoconference    Final Review Meeting    Teleconference\/videoconference    Problem Summary Statement     Shared Services Canada is seeking an innovative solution that will collect and analyze information from multiple data centres in order to provide options for reducing\/consolidating infrastructure and strategies\/plans for data centre migrations.    Problem Statement     SSC currently spends a large amount of time, money and resources gathering information on current technologies, applications and services in aging data centres, using out-of-date tools and information, and a manual decision-making process on the best strategy to consolidate all federal data centres into 10 or less. The current process for gathering the necessary information on the infrastructure, applications and services that reside in Legacy Data Centres is extremely time-consuming and cumbersome. SSC must engage the individual owners (other federal departments) of these Legacy Data Centres in order to obtain a snapshot in time of constantly changing information, using whichever local tools are available in that particular data centre. These tools often cannot show important interdependencies or required Facilities as a Service (FaaS). Once this data is gathered, it must be manually consolidated in order to perform an options analysis to identify best fit of services into an Enterprise Data Centre (EDC). This process is also lengthy, resource intensive and the information is often out of date by the time the options analysis phase can begin, creating the risk of missing opportunities for consolidation, and infrastructure reduction. In addition, there is no capability to analyze Cloud-readiness or opportunities for innovation.    Desired outcomes and Considerations      Essential (Mandatory) Outcomes    Proposed solutions must:     be able to collect data and deliver to a central location\/repository across multiple VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)   consume no more than 1Unit of rack space   consume no more than 15Watts of power   be able to analyze information obtained during discovery and provide options for reducing\/consolidating infrastructure   be able to analyze information obtained during discovery and provide strategies\/plans for data centre migrations      Additional Outcomes    Proposed solutions should:     cost less or be on par with current data centre discovery tools available on the market.   be deployable using a small footprint, or from a centralized location (e.g. Cloud) without requiring large initial investments and\/or expensive operating costs (ex: $1 Million for 5,000 configuration items discovered)      Background and Context     SSC is mandated to consolidate all Government of Canada data centres down to 10 or less. SSC is operating over 500 data centres of varying size for multiple clients in sole-tenant\/multi-tenant configurations. The technology landscape varies from client to client in terms of:   \u2022 Age   \u2022 Operating Systems   \u2022 Software Development Lifecycle   \u2022 Degree of virtualization   \u2022 Sensitivity of information   \u2022 Criticality of workload   \u2022 Number of users   \u2022 Geography   \u2022 Physical Scale   \u2022 Magnitude of data   \u2022 Business considerations and Service Level Agreements, such as black-out periods, high-availability   \u2022 Use of mainframes.   Most legacy data centres that are being analyzed are at capacity for power, space, and compute.

Subsequently, qualified suppliers meeting the mandatory criteria of the RFSA, will be eligible to become a Supply Arrangement holder for the supply of Type I 4x4 Ambulances.   These vehicles are for delivery across Canada, excluding locations within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, and Labrador that are subject to Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements (CLCAs). Any requirement for deliveries to locations within CLCAs areas within Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Quebec, or Labrador will have to be treated as a separate procurement, outside of the resulting supply arrangements.   An SA is a non-binding arrangement between Canada and a pre-qualified supplier that allows departments and agencies to award contracts and solicit bids from a pool of pre-qualified suppliers for specific requirements within the scope of the SA.  An SA is not a contract for the provision of the goods and services described in it and neither party is legally bound, as a result of signing a supply arrangement alone. The intent of a supply arrangement is to establish a framework to permit expeditious processing of individual bid solicitations, which result in legally binding contracts for the goods and services described in those bid solicitations.  All arrangements submitted under this Request for Supply Arrangements (RFSA) will be evaluated by Canada.  Suppliers meeting the technical capabilities will be placed on the SA.  Only suppliers who have been pre-qualified and have been awarded an SA will be allowed to submit bids for individual RFPs.  The period of the SAs will be indefinite from the date of issue.  Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity for qualification during the SA validity period. A continuous Notice will be posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) to allow new Suppliers to become qualified. Existing qualified Suppliers, who have been issued a supply arrangement, will not be required to submit a new arrangement. The existing qualified Suppliers will have an on-going opportunity during the SA validity period to qualify new products.

The maximum funding available for any Phase 1 Contract resulting from this Challenge is $150,000.00 CAD (plus tax) including shipping, travel and living expenses, as applicable, for up to 6 months.   The maximum funding available for any Phase 2 Contract resulting from this Challenge is $1,000,000.00 CAD (plus tax) including shipping, travel and living expenses, as applicable, for up to\u00a024 months. Only eligible businesses that have completed Phase 1 could be considered for Phase 2.   This disclosure is made in good faith and does not commit Canada to contract for the total approximate funding.    TRAVEL:  \u00a0   For Phase 1 it is anticipated that two (2) meetings will require the successful bidder(s) to travel to the location identified below:    Kick-off meeting    Ottawa, ON    Final Review Meeting    Ottawa, ON   All other communication can take place by telephone.    Problem Summary Statement     The National Research Council (NRC)\u00a0is seeking a solution to develop stable liposome formulations, with narrow size distributions at nanoscale and sub-micron scales, to support the development of drug product submissions, streamline the regulatory approval process and improve the manufacturability of drug delivery formulations.    Problem Statement     Liposomes are used as drug delivery vehicles in indications such as cancer, pain management and vaccines. Each liposome can be uniquely produced to match the drug to be delivered and the target tissue. Among others, the physical properties of liposomes such as stability, storage, sterilization, size and charge are factors in determining their applicability and suitability for drug delivery. However, maintaining the physical properties of liposomal formulations can be difficult. For example, stability is impacted by chemical degradation, which results in phospholipid structure changes. Physical agglomeration or aggregation can change the uniformity of size distribution and encapsulation efficiency, which has an impact on the shelf-life of liposomes. Changes in the size distribution and stability problems due to the hydrolytic and oxidative degradation are general problems upon storage. NRC\u2019s certified reference material program provides reference standards and methods to confirm the physical characteristics and quality of a particle. The lack of a stable liposome formulation prevents the development of certified reference material. NRC is seeking a solution to develop stable drug carrier formulations with narrow size distributions at nanoscale and sub-micron scales, to enable the development of certified reference material to support drug product submissions, streamline the regulatory approval process and improve the manufacturability of drug delivery formulations.    Desired outcomes and Considerations      Essential (Mandatory) Outcomes    Proposed solutions  must :     enable the development of drug loaded liposomes, with stable sizes, in three (3) formulations, with the following physical properties:\u00a0    at least three different sizes (60\u00b110 nm, 100\u00b110 nm, 200\u00b120 nm);\u3000     with a polydispersity index (PDI) of      positive, neutral and negative charges (e.g. one charge per size is reasonable);        demonstrate the development of lipid nanoparticle products based on new formulations (including, but not limited to, lipidoids) targeted for gene or cell therapies;   demonstrate that the potency of the carrier is better than or similar to the lipid particle for the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved RNAi (Ribonucleic acid interference) patisiran drug by Alnylam;   if using cationic, neutral or anionic lipid compositions to prepare the three particle sizes as described above, ensure that the oxidation and hydrolysis issues are addressed clearly;   ensure that the liposome particle size and PDIs are maintained during storage, for a minimum period of three (3) years. Note: long-term storage of liposomes in frozen state is acceptable as long as the target specifications are maintained; and   develop liposomes that are non-toxic and therefore suitable for use in drug delivery.     Bidders  must  demonstrate the ability to:     produce 200 units of each size and deliver to NRC for verification in a lab environment in Phase 1;   produce 2,000 units for one selected size before the end of Phase\u00a02 (selected bidders may be required to provide to NRC as part of a resulting contract); and,   demonstrate Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) level of large scale production drug\/oligonucleotide carriers.      Additional Outcomes    N\/A    Background and Context     Liposomes are complex formulations. Liposome drug products consist of the liposome and the drug molecule. A liposome is made up of lipids, each of which has a head region, tail region and a linker that connects both regions. Tail length, tail unsaturation, linker type and head group structure all contribute to the performance characteristics of a liposome drug product. It is the unique combination of differing characteristics of these regions that determines their stability. For example, low degrees of tail unsaturation and ether increase biodegradation. The size and charge of the lipid head group can influence drug permeation. The selection of a lipid to formulate the liposome is important, and will depend on desired factors which determine safety, stability, efficiency. Because liposomes are complex, small changes in formulation may significantly affect clinical results. Pharmaceutical companies develop in-house standards to verify the results of their research and validate the manufacturability and production quality of a liposome drug product. A summary of the product characteristics and the test results forms part of the regulatory submission. However, the submission does not include the necessary information to enable the regulatory agency to verify the product characteristics or test results. The quality and performance of a liposome drug product can be impacted by many factors, including drug loading and drug leakage. However, the method by which the liposome drug product is developed is considered a trade secret, owned by the producer. Therefore, the unique characteristics of each drug\/carrier combination can only be verified by the producer. Certified reference materials are a measurement standard used to confirm the physical characteristics and quality of a particle with a given uncertainty or traceability, to validate methods of measurement, and\/or to calibrate instruments. Certified reference materials for liposomes do not exist. There is currently no ability for the scientific community, regulatory agencies, third-party laboratories or liposome producers to confirm the characteristics of a liposome against a known sample. The lack of a stable liposome product prevents the development of certified reference material for liposomes. This challenge seeks a solution to develop stable drug carrier formulations to support the NRC development of certified reference material. The lack of commercially available reference standards for liposomes slows the regulatory review process, and creates inefficiencies and quality control issues in the drug production process. Certified reference materials for liposomes create a publicly available measurement standard which can expedite the market adoption of liposome-assisted drug delivery by supporting the development of drug product submissions, streamlining the regulatory approval process and improving the manufacturability of drug delivery formulations.

The maximum funding available for any Phase 1 Contract resulting from this Challenge is $150,000.00 CAD (plus tax) including shipping, travel and living expenses, as applicable, for up to 6 months.

This disclosure is made in good faith and does not commit Canada to contract for the total approximate funding.    TRAVEL:  \u00a0   For Phase 1 it is anticipated that two (2) meetings will require the successful bidder(s) to travel to the location identified below:    Kick-off meeting    Edmonton, AB    Final Review Meeting    Edmonton, AB   All other communication can take place by telephone.    Problem Summary Statement     The National Research Council (NRC) is seeking a ceramic powder processing solution that will upgrade raw ceramic powder into a uniformly coated, sinterable, hybrid carbon nanotube ceramic powder with > 1 kg \/ h production rates, in order for NRC to do further research into possible applications for this new stronger composite material such as light-weight armours.    Problem Statement     Carbon nanotubes have great potential for mechanical reinforcement in composite materials, including ceramic composites. However, bundling of the carbon nanotubes has prevented this potential from being realized. To overcome these bundling issues, the carbon nanotubes are being deposited by chemical vapour deposition methods onto ceramic powders, which have been stained with the catalyst. The resulting hybrid powders can then be sintered into the composite, in other words, compacted and bonded at high temperature and pressure into a solid plate. The nanotubes are deposited in an unbundled state on the ceramic powder and remain that way after sintering, which is the desired outcome, but the lack of uniformity in the deposition results in weaknesses of the material. In order to get a uniform distribution of these unbundled carbon nanotubes in the composite, the carbon nanotubes must be uniformly deposited onto the ceramic powders. There are technical challenges to overcome in getting this uniform deposition, including issues with catalyst causing the powder to clump up and the need for a uniform gas flow around the catalyst coated ceramic powders during the chemical vapour deposition process. This call concerns overcoming these challenges. NRC is seeking a ceramic powder processing solution that will upgrade raw ceramic powder into a uniformly coated, sinterable, hybrid carbon nanotube ceramic powder that can be produced with production rates > 1 kg \/ h.    Desired Outcomes and Considerations     Essential (Mandatory) Outcomes    Proposed solutions  must :     Produce a uniform distribution of carbon nanotubes at loadings up to 3% (by weight) on the surface of ground alumina powder grains starting from neat alumina powder. The neat alumina powder must be of a size of 0.5\u00a0m or less (d50). The loading (measured by thermal gravimetric analysis in air) must have a precision of better than 0.1%. The uniformity must be confirmable by imaging under a scanning electron microscope and there cannot be regions where the alumina grains are not loaded with nanotubes.   Deposit high quality carbon nanotubes onto the powder grains, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The Raman spectrum and TGA thermogram must be consistent with high quality single or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Imaging by scanning electron microscopy must show high aspect ratio (a long length compared to their diameter), straight nanotubes. Imaging by transmission electron microscopy must show a high degree of graphitization.   Also work for carbon nanotube deposition onto silicon carbide powders.   Process the powder at a rate of greater than 1 kg \/ h.   Include all the necessary interlocks for safe, hands-off operation by a trained operator.   Be automated for programmable, repeatable operations.   Be able to operate for 24 h without stopping.   Include all gas cabinets needed for safe handling of process gases.   Include all abatement systems needed for safe process gas exhausting.   Have a footprint of less than 10 m 2  and be less than 3 m in height.   Work at pressures ranging from atmospheric to below 0.1 bar.      Additional Outcomes    N\/A    Background and Context     Carbon nanotubes \u2013 ceramic composites are of particular interest for developing light weight armour by Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) and their clients. Through the DRDC-funded Advanced Ceramic Plate Technology project, NRC in collaboration with Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and DRDC have been exploring methods for producing and sintering hybrid carbon nanotube ceramic materials in order to produce composite plates. Processing of ultrafine ceramic powders (e.g. Alteo P172LSB super ground reactive alumina, 99.8%, 0.4 \u00b5m D50) into carbon nanotube hybrids by chemical vapour deposition methods followed by high pressure sintering has been found to be a very promising approach. However, progress is currently limited by the available batch processing chemical vapour deposition reactor. The limitations are related to inhomogeneity of the sinterable hybrids, which leads to inhomogeneity in the sintered composite. This inhomogeneity can be traced to two sources. The first is clumping of the ceramic powder during catalyst deposition. This problem is currently being addressed by first calcining the catalyst precursor stained powder in air, followed by jet milling. This process is effective but is very time consuming and expensive. A more efficient process is desirable, such as the deposition of the catalyst concurrently with the carbon nanotube deposition (so-called floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition). The second source is related to the static, batch processing being employed. Currently, the powder is placed in a pan and processed as in a batch mode. This mode leads to depletion effects whereby the reactive gas concentration drops as one goes deeper into the thickness of the powder, leading to greater carbon nanotube deposition at the top of the powder layer than further down.\u00a0NRC does\u00a0not currently have a method of overcoming this problem; however, tumbling furnaces are commercially available to move the powder during processing and could be engineered into a chemical vapour reactor for carbon nanotube deposition. Other methods may also be possible, including possibly fluidized bed reactors or spray reactors.

Problem Summary Statement     The CFIA is seeking a solution that will use predictive computer models for Foot-and-Mouth disease vaccine matching.    Problem Statement     In the case of a Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD) outbreak, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) would be responsible for responding to it, including by selecting the most appropriate vaccine to use. Vaccination is accepted as a control measure to respond to an outbreak of FMD and therefore it is important to match the vaccine, antigenically, as closely as possible to the causative field isolate. Use of vaccine matching is crucial for successful implementation of vaccination-based FMD control policy. There are several in vivo and in vitro techniques to match a vaccine stored in the vaccine bank to the outbreak virus. However, most are time consuming and highly variable.   Recently computational approaches such as antigenic cartography have been used to predict serological relationships between FMD viruses. These techniques facilitate quantification and visualization of antigenic relationships of vaccine strains and field viruses based on their antigenic distance generated from normalized serological and\/or sequence data. Currently there is a need to develop more accurate computational systems to support antigenic characterization and FMDV matching studies to allow more precise measurement of antigenic relationships between antibody and FMDV antigen to support vaccine selection after a FMD outbreak.    Desired outcomes and Considerations       Essential (Mandatory) Outcomes     Proposed solutions must:      be able to perform antigenic cartography and antigen analysis using virus neutralization data\u00a0     be able to analyze over 100 antigens (virus) and compare each antigen to a set of reference sera to establish antigenic relation     display results in graphic form for easy interpretation     produce antigenic mapping correlated with the genetic makeup of virus isolates     detect emerging variants based on differences in antigenic distances     identify potential options for cross reactivity and cross protection between defined FMDV antigens     provide an in silico assessment of the relation between a FMD field virus and strains stored at a vaccine bank       Additional Outcomes    Proposed solutions should:      facilitate the selection of FMD vaccines based on circulating strains in high risk areas of the world     provide a visual computer interface to facilitate input and interpretation of results     be applicable to other diseases       \u00a0 Background and Context      Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD) is a severe, highly communicable viral disease of cattle and swine. It also affects sheep, goats, deer and other cloven-hoofed ruminants. In addition to causing production losses, FMD can have a severe economic impact in endemic countries through, among other things, restriction of trade with FMD-free countries. Incursion from endemic countries into disease-free areas also carries high animal welfare and economic costs.      FMD vaccination is a key element for the control of the disease. FMD vaccines consist of chemically inactivated purified whole virus preparations. The high level of antigenic variation in FMD virus (FMDV) means that currently there is no universal vaccine that can afford protection against all serotypes of the virus. Antigenic diversity between serotypes and genotypes means that vaccination with another serotype or other genotypes of the same serotype may fail to control the disease. Consequently, the vaccine strain requirements differ according to the serotypes and genotypes of viruses prevailing in or threatening different regions, and vaccines have to be selected with care. FMD free countries, such as Canada, store various strains of inactivated FMDV antigen over liquid nitrogen in an antigenic vaccine bank, ready for immediate formulation into a vaccine if required during an emergency. The vaccine strains stored in the bank are generally chosen on the basis of the perceived coverage against a number of different field isolates circulating globally. Current vaccines have been used successfully to aid in the eradication of the virus from many areas of the globe.   As the antigenic diversity of FMDV is a major concern for FMD control, regular vaccine matching and strain selection studies appropriate for each region are essential for disease control. In the face of an outbreak, both in vivo and in vitro methods of vaccine matching are not easy, and time consuming. Therefore easy and rapid selection of vaccine strains in an outbreak situation is required. The FMDV capsid contains all the immunogenic epitopes, and therefore a sequence based method of vaccine selection may be a promising tool for future studies. Vaccine strain prediction models using both capsid sequence and serology data will likely replace existing tools in the future. Regional vaccine matching and selection studies using relevant circulating field viruses need to be carried out regularly to ensure the vaccine strain selected is a good match with the circulating field viruses.   Canada is a member of the North American FMD vaccine bank (NAFMDVB). This bank was established between Canada, Mexico and the United States to ensure that a FMD vaccine would be available to help control an outbreak of FMD on the North American continent, and to assist in contingency planning for an outbreak of FMD. The Bank has been in existence since 1982, during which time there have been no outbreaks of FMD in North America. However, there has been a recent change in the assessment of the risk of an FMD outbreak. It was originally perceived that FMD virus would cause an outbreak following its illegal, but accidental introduction. Since 2001 the possibility also exists that FMD virus could be intentionally introduced. The specter of a large scale outbreak of FMD on the North American continent has provided impetus to more quickly establish a comprehensive inventory of antigens within the Bank, to cover the potential outbreak strains.   Since 2010, Canada, Mexico and the United States have begun including vaccination as one of the options policy makers may use during a first response in an outbreak. Therefore a rapid identification of the best vaccine to use is of paramount importance. The development of tools to predict the antigenic relationship between viruses stored in the vaccine bank and field viruses is critical to rapidly implement a vaccination strategy.\u00a0    ENQUIRIES     All enquiries must be submitted in writing to  TPSGC.SIC-ISC.PWGSC@tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca  no later than ten calendar days before the Challenge Notice closing date.

This industry consultation process provides industry the opportunity to provide feedback in the development and refinement of the requirement, including the proposed technical requirement, the procurement strategy and methods of leveraging economic benefit for Canada.   The information gathered through this industry consultation process may be used by Canada to assist in the development of a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the implementation of the SofS 2 procurement. As such, the requirement may be revised pending alternate solutions and discussions that take place during all industry engagement processes.  BACKGROUND  The Canadian Armed Forces rely heavily on space-based assets to conduct operations. The space environment is increasingly congested due to the dramatic increase in commercial and other satellites and debris. Potential adversaries also possess increasingly sophisticated anti-satellite weapons. In the context of this environment, access to Space Situational Awareness (SSA) helps ensure the security and integrity of national space-based capabilities, the awareness of space threats to Canadian territory, and support to Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) operations worldwide. In 2013, the Department of National Defence (DND) and the CAF launched their first military satellite, Sapphire, a Space Based Optical (SBO) sensor that provides valuable Space Situational Awareness to both Canada and its allies. SSA products allow Canada to accurately assess the orbital positions and projected paths of our space assets.   Surveillance of Space 2 (SofS 2) offers Canada the opportunity to build on the performance of Sapphire and to continue Canada\u0092s status as a valuable contributor to the US owned and operated Space Surveillance Network (SSN) and enjoy guaranteed access to the SSN. The preferred capability for the SofS 2 solution is Optical and may include a Ground Based Optical (GBO), SBO (which may include multiples) or a combination of both GBO and SBO(s); an enduring SSA capability that provides best value for cost is a key consideration for DND.    REQUIREMENT  The SofS 2 project is considering a GBO System as a means to mitigate a potential loss of SSA should Sapphire fail prior to the next generation SBO becoming available. Further, it is expected that the GBO System would supplement the next generation SBO System to achieve an even greater SSA capability. This RFI solely addresses the request for solutions to a GBO System for SSA; please refer to the RFI document for more details.

Box 3232, Vancouver, BC, V6B 3X8. Before awarding a contract, however, the government would like to provide other suppliers with the opportunity to demonstrate that they are capable of satisfying the requirements set out in this Notice, by submitting a statement of capabilities during the ACAN posting period.   If other potential suppliers submit a statement of capabilities during this ACAN posting period that meets the requirements set out in the ACAN, the government will proceed to a full tendering process on either GETS or through traditional means, in order to award the contract.   If no other supplier submits, on or before the closing date, a statement of capabilities meeting the requirements set out in the ACAN, a contract will be awarded to the pre-selected supplier.    BACKGROUND:    As part of the Ocean Protection Plan (OPP) Program, DFO has been asked to develop a Coastal Environmental Baseline Program in two Pilot Areas (Port of Prince Rupert and Port of Vancouver) to support evidence-based decision making and Transport Canada\u2019s Framework to Assess the Cumulative Impacts of Marine Shipping (which is currently under development).   Ocean Wise Conservation Association (Ocean Wise) is a Vancouver-based not-for-profit organization whose \u201cvision is a world in which oceans are healthy and flourishing\u201d. Ocean Wise is home to researchers at the forefront of a number of conservation science and ocean health initiatives, including research on ocean pollution. One of the key initiatives is  PollutionTracker , a partner-supported pollution monitoring network for coastal British Columbia.  PollutionTracker  is the first coast-wide pollution monitoring program in Canada, launched in British Columbia (BC) in 2015 to help answer the question: How polluted is our ocean?    PollutionTracker  is using high resolution analysis to report the levels and trends of over 450 potential contaminants of concern in mussels and nearshore subtidal sediment along the entire coast of BC. Additional shellfish species (e.g., clams, crabs) are being sampled at the request of partners in response to First Nations concerns. The long-term dataset will further our understanding of ecosystem health and to help inform contaminant source identification, pollution priorities, best practices, and natural resource management in BC.\u00a0   To date,  PollutionTracker  has established over 60 sites coast-wide.  PollutionTracker  operates on a 3-year cycle, with collection of samples in years 1 and 2, and data analysis and reporting in year 3. The program is currently in year 2 of its second 3-year phase. A dedicated interactive website has been established to provide and disseminate summarized results and contaminant information to program partners, natural resource managers, and the public (http:\/\/pollutiontracker.org\/).   Sampling of sediment and mussels in Indian Arm was completed by Ocean Wise in collaboration with the Tsleil-Waututh Nation in December 2016 and January 2019. Sampling in and around the Port of Prince Rupert was conducted in collaboration with the Port Authority, the Metlakatla First Nation, and the Lax Kw\u2019alaams Band in April 2016 and March 2019. This project will build on, and complement, previous work by filling in spatial and temporal data gaps in the Vancouver and Prince Rupert port areas.    OBJECTIVES    This project will help build a baseline contaminant database for the coast of BC, specifically for sites within an area surrounding the Port of Prince Rupert area and Port of Vancouver area, as part of the OPP Coastal Environmental Baseline Program. This project will build on previous work completed by Ocean Wise, First Nations and coastal organizations and will help fill spatial and temporal data gaps in these areas.    REQUIREMENTS - TASKS AND ACTIVITIES     Description of work    Contract requirements include  PollutionTracker  field sampling, laboratory analyses, data analysis, reporting, and the public dissemination of summarized results through the interactive  PollutionTracker  website ( http:\/\/pollutiontracker.org\/ ). Field sampling will be conducted in the late fall\/winter of 2019\/2020, followed by laboratory analyses. Chemical contaminant analyses will be conducted by external specialist laboratories, while microplastics will be analyzed internally. Data analysis and reporting will be conducted in 2020\/2021. Project costs are largely fees for laboratory analyses (approximately 75% of total project costs).    Details of requirements    The contractor is required to have substantial experience with field sampling, chemical and microplastics analyses, and data analysis and reporting of contaminant results though the  PollutionTracker  initiative (including the dissemination of summarized results through the interactive website -  http:\/\/pollutiontracker.org\/ ). The contractor is required to deliver the following final products at the completion of the contract: (1) raw and summarized contaminants data for the sites included in this contract; (2) summary reports for each port area; (3) updates to the  PollutionTracker  website to include summarized results for the sites included in this contract.","title":"PollutionTracker Data Collection for the Vancouver and Prince Rupert Port Areas as part of the Ocean Protection Plan - Coastal Environmental Baseline Program (F5211-190359)","trade_agreement":"Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT), Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA)","id":724},{"GSIN_code":["D302A"],"URL":"https:\/\/buyandsell.gc.ca\/procurement-data\/tender-notice\/PW-19-00888100","buyer_contact":"Wassink, Nico, nicole.wassink@forces.gc.ca, 819-939-4528, 101 Colonel By Drive Ottawa ON K1A 0K2 CA, 101 Colonel By Drive Ottawa ON K1A 0K2 CA","buyer_name":"Department of National Defence","closing_date":"2019-09-19 14:00:00-04:00","location_of_work":"National Capital Region","procurement_rules":"Selective","province_territory_of_work":["ON","QC"],"published_date":"2019-09-05","selection_criteria":null,"tender_description":"NOTICE OF PROPOSED PROCUREMENT (NPP) for TASK-BASED INFORMATICS PROFESSIONAL SERVICES (TBIPS)    This bid solicitation cancels and supersedes previous bid solicitation number W6369-20-X003 dated 09 Aug 2019 with a closing date of 27 August 2019 at 2:00 pm EDT.

In late 2013, The City\u2019s Information Technology (IT) Business Unit was notified by its then current PTT service provider they were decommissioning PTT services by the end of 2016. \n\nIn response to the impending changes, The City collected information from the market through Request for Information (RFI) 14-038 requesting information on alternative solutions. Based on those responses, The City\u2019s IT Business Unit determined that Bell Mobility (\"Bell\") was the only solution able to fulfil the services requirements of The City. \n\nIn late 2015, The City issued an NOI 15-055 advising of The City\u2019s intent to enter into an Agreement with Bell Mobility.

All health research in Alberta that requires AHS resources requires approval by AHS.\n\nThe University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, and Alberta Health Services (with representation from the Cross Cancer Institute and the Tom Baker Cancer Centre), are the major stakeholders involved in the conduct of clinical trials in Alberta. These institutions have formed the Alberta CTMS Group.\n\nThere are more than 1,800 active trials in Alberta, and approximately 800 investigators and trial support staff. Conducting a trial requires strict regulatory compliance and adherence to complex protocol schedules. To meet these requirements, tracking and documentation tools are essential. With the current absence of a centralized system, researchers are using Excel spreadsheets, email and paper based processes to manage their clinical trial activities. These methods result in data entry duplication, lack of standardization, lack of notification ability, and lack of quality assurance. \n\nThe adoption of a Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS) could:\n\n\u2022 Improve patient safety, management and overall trial experience;\n\u2022 Improve budgeting and financial management, invoicing, reconciliation and financial reporting;\n\u2022 Facilitate provincial collaboration on clinical trials;\n\u2022 Reduce the burden of administrative tasks associated with clinical trial activity;\n\u2022 Support regulatory, billing and protocol compliance; and\n\u2022 Help establish provincial standards for reporting and decision making.\n\nThe Alberta CTMS Group is seeking proposals from qualified vendors to supply, install, configure and support a CTMS. \n\nIt is anticipated, that implementing one solution across the province shall lead to cost benefits derived from economies of scale most particularly in respect of implementation, maintenance and license fees.  It is expected the interface with the provincial Electronic Health Record (EHR) system (Epic) will be a benefit more quickly realized with a single provincial CTMS.","title":"Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS)","trade_agreement":"NWPTA\/TILMA & CFTA","id":1078},{"GSIN_code":["5153A","5153AD","5169E","5179FB","N5650BA"],"URL":"http:\/\/vendor.purchasingconnection.ca\/Opportunity.aspx?Guid=0E99F2A3-2B36-4BE4-A639-A01AF68C1827","buyer_contact":"Laura Dutton\ne-mail all questions","buyer_name":null,"closing_date":"2019-07-17T20:00:59","location_of_work":"Alberta","procurement_rules":"Open & Competitive","province_territory_of_work":"Alberta","published_date":"2019-06-21T20:08:20","selection_criteria":null,"tender_description":"Calgary Housing Company is seeking a contractor to replace the existing roof shingles on four buildings with siding as well as replacement building windows, window wells and landings at the same four buildings.","title":"Mansard Roof Replacements and Basement Window Replacements DV1","trade_agreement":"NWPTA\/TILMA","id":1079},{"GSIN_code":["N2610","N2630","N3825","N3830","N3830L","N3895"],"URL":"http:\/\/vendor.purchasingconnection.ca\/Opportunity.aspx?Guid=A7E694C5-1C69-47CC-9E41-A0BC3B572219","buyer_contact":"Zach Mazure\n780-672-4449","buyer_name":null,"closing_date":"2019-12-31T23:30:00","location_of_work":"Alberta","procurement_rules":"Open & Competitive","province_territory_of_work":"Alberta","published_date":"2019-01-11T16:39:42","selection_criteria":null,"tender_description":"In 2019, Camrose County will be utilizing the procurement programs available through the Rural Municipalities of Alberta (RMA) where practicable.\nAs above","title":"Notice of Procurement utilizing RMA & Sourcewell","trade_agreement":"NWPTA\/TILMA & CFTA","id":1080},{"GSIN_code":["N3895A","N3895AA","N5610A","N5610E","N5620E","N8040AA"],"URL":"http:\/\/vendor.purchasingconnection.ca\/Opportunity.aspx?Guid=010CC7B2-B549-4207-AA9B-A0D10836C2C8","buyer_contact":"Stacyann Tinglin\n4033564917","buyer_name":null,"closing_date":"2019-07-15T20:00:00","location_of_work":"Alberta","procurement_rules":"Open & Competitive","province_territory_of_work":"Alberta","published_date":"2019-06-18T17:58:06","selection_criteria":null,"tender_description":"This RFP is an invitation to submit offers for the provision of a Contractor to provide services for asphalt surfaces including but not limited to roadways, trails, sidewalks\/pavements and parking lots at RDC\u2019s campuses on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis.

The Town of Olds has adopted the great horned owl as it mascot, Oliver Olds is all over Olds.\nThe Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus) is Alberta\u2019s Provincial Bird. Great Horned Owls reside all year long in Alberta and are common throughout Alberta. It is readily identified by its large size and prominent \"horns\" pointed toward the sides of the head. The neck and back are light brown speckled, streaked and barred with black and white. The undersides are light in color and heavily barred, accentuating the white throat. These owls are very stealthy. Their feathers offer camouflaging to the surrounding treed habitat and they are nearly silent when in flight. All great horned owls have a facial disc.
